<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><strong>A congenital anomaly</strong> (congenital abnormality, congenital malformation, birth defect) is a condition which is present at the time of birth which varies from the standard presentation  of a normal child. &nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><strong>Types of congenital abnormalities </strong></div><br><div>  These depend on the system or structure of the body affected
</div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">A limb anomaly is called a <strong>dysmelia</strong>. These include all forms of limbs anomalies, such as amelia, ectrodactyly, phocomelia, polymelia, polydactyly, syndactyly, polysyndactyly, oligodactyly, brachydactyly, achondroplasia, congenital aplasia or hypoplasia, amniotic band syndrome, and cleidocranial dysostosis.&nbsp;</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><strong>Congenital anomalies of the heart</strong></span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">include patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and tetralogy of fallots.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></div><div>Congenital anomalies of the nervous system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, meningocele, meningomyelocele, encephalocele and anencephaly. Arnold-Chiari malformation,  Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, microencephaly, megencephaly, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, holoprosencephaly, and agenesis of the corpus callosum.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal system include numerous forms of stenosis and atresia, and imperforate.</div><br><br><div>
</div><div>Occurrence rate of congenital anomalies</div><br><div>
</div><div>About 3% of newborns have a "major physical anomaly", meaning a physical anomaly that has cosmetic or functional significance. 
</div><div>Congenital anomalies involving the brain are the largest group at 10 per 1000 live births, compared to heart at 8 per 1000, kidneys at 4 per 1000, and limbs at 1 per 1000. All other physical anomalies have a combined incidence of 6 per 1000 live births.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Congenital anomalies of the heart have the highest risk of death in infancy, accounting for 28% of infant deaths due to congenital anomaly, while chromosomal anomalies and respiratory anomalies each account for 15% and brain anomalies about 12%.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Causes of congenital anomalies.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The cause of 40-60% of congenital anomalies in humans is unknown. For 20-25% of anomalies there seems to be a "multifactorial" cause, meaning a complex interaction of multiple minor genetic anomalies with environmental risk factors. Another 10-13% of anomalies have a purely environmental cause (e.g. infections, illness, or drug abuse in the mother). Only 12-25% of anomalies have a purely genetic cause. Of these, the majority are chromosomal anomalies.</div><br><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;Genetic causes of congenital anomalies include inheritance of abnormal genes from the parents, as well as new mutations in one of the germ cells that gave rise to the fetus.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Environmental causes of congenital anomalies are referred to as teratogenic. These are generally problems with the mother's environment. Teratogens can include dietary deficiencies, toxins, or infections. For example, dietary deficiency of maternal folic acid is associated with spina bifida. Ingestion of harmful substances by the mother (e.g., alcohol, mercury, or prescription drugs such as phenytoin) can cause recognizable combinations of birth defects.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Several infections which a mother can contract during pregnancy can also be teratogenic. These are referred to as the TORCHES infections.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Teratogens</div><br><div>
</div><div>The greatest risk of a malformation due to environmental exposure to a teratogen (terato = monster, gen = producing) between the third and eighth week of gestation. Before this time, any damage to the embryo is likely to result in fatality, and the baby will not be born. After eight weeks, the fetus and its organs are more developed and less sensitive to teratogenic incidents.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The type of congenital anomaly is also related to the time of exposure to a teratogen. For instance, the heart is susceptible from three to eight weeks, but the ear is susceptible from a slightly later time to about twelve weeks.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Many common skin care ingredients can be absorbed through the skin in small amounts, where they can enter the bloodstream and pass into the fetus's circulation.[ Infection in the mother early in the third week may cause fetal cardiac damage. An infection in the eleventh week is less likely to damage the heart, but the baby may be born deaf. A common cause of congenital deafness of children in particular is a measles infection in the mother
</div><br><div><br></div><div><strong>DOWN SYNDROME
</strong></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Down syndrome (DS) or Down's syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a chromosomal condition caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is the most common chromosome abnormality in humans. It is typically associated with a delay in cognitive ability (mental retardation,) and physical growth, and a particular set of facial characteristics. </span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The average IQ of young adults with Down syndrome is around 50; compared to children without the condition with an IQ of 100 (MR has historically been defined as an IQ below 70.) A large proportion of individuals with Down syndrome have a severe degree of intellectual disability. Down syndrome is named after John Langdon Down, the British physician who described the syndrome in 1866. Down syndrome was identified as a chromosome 21 trisomy by Dr. Jérôme Lejeune in 1959. Down syndrome can be identified in a baby at birth or even before birth by prenatal screening. Pregnancies with this diagnosis are often terminated.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Many children with Down syndrome graduate from high school and are able to do paid work, and some participate in post-secondary education as well. Education and proper care has been shown to improve quality of life significantly
</div><div>Signs and symptoms</div><br><div>
</div><div>. Down syndrome is characterized by decelerated maturation (neoteny), incomplete morphogenesis (vestigia) and atavisms Individuals with Down syndrome may have some or all of the following physical characteristics: microgenia (abnormally small chin), oblique eye fissures with epicanthic skin folds on the inner corner of the eyes (formerly known as a mongoloid fold), muscle hypotonia (poor muscle tone), a flat nasal bridge, a single palmar fold, a protruding tongue (due to small oral cavity, and an enlarged tongue near the tonsils) or macroglossia, "face is flat and broad" a short neck, white spots on the iris known as Brushfield spots, excessive joint laxity including atlanto-axial instability, excessive space between large toe and second toe, a single flexion furrow of the fifth finger, a higher number of ulnar loop </div><br><div>dermatoglyphs and short fingers.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>Growth parameters such as height, weight, and head circumference are smaller in children with DS than with typical individuals of the same age. Adults with DS tend to have short stature and bowed legs—the average height for men is 5 feet 1 inch (154 cm) and for women is 4 feet 9 inches (144 cm). Individuals with DS are also at increased risk for obesity as they age.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Individuals with Down syndrome have a higher risk for many conditions. The medical consequences of the extra genetic material in Down syndrome are highly variable, may affect the function of any organ system or bodily process, and can contribute to a shorter life expectancy for people with Down syndrome 
</div><div>Mental characteristics and neurology</div><br><div>
</div><div>Most individuals with Down syndrome have intellectual disability ,Individuals with Down syndrome have a speech delay. Fine motor skills are delayed and often lag behind gross motor skills and can interfere with cognitive development. . Some children will begin walking at around 2 years of age, while others will not walk until age four. Children and adults with DS are at increased risk for developing epilepsy and also Alzheimer's disease.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>Congenital heart disease</div><br><div>
</div><div>The incidence of congenital heart disease in newborn babies with Down syndrome is up to 50%.An atrioventricular septal defect also known as endocardial cushion defect is the most common form with up to 40% of patients affected. This is closely followed by ventricular septal defect that affects approximately 35% of patients. 
</div><div><br></div><br><div>Cancer</div><br><div>
</div><div>Although the general incidence of cancer amongst individuals with Down syndrome is the same as the general population, there are greatly reduced incidence of many common malignancies except leukemia and testicular cancer People with Down syndrome also have a much lower risk of hardening of the arteries and diabetic retinopathy.</div><br><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;Hematologic malignancies such as leukemia are more common in children with DS. In particular, the risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemiais at least 10 times more common in DS and for the megakaryoblastic form of acute myelogenous leukemia is at least 50 times more common in DS. Transient leukemia is a form of leukemia that is rare in individuals without DS but affects up to 20 percent of newborns with DS. This form of leukemia is typically benign and resolves on its own over several months, though it can lead to other serious illnesses. In contrast to hematologic malignancies, solid tumor malignancies are less common in DS, possibly due to increased numbers of tumor suppressor genes contained in the extra genetic material.</div><br><div>Thyroid disorders
</div><div>Individuals with DS are at increased risk for dysfunction of the thyroid gland, an organ that helps control metabolism. Low thyroid (hypothyroidism) is most common, occurring in almost a third of those with DS. This can be due to absence of the thyroid at birth (congenital hypothyroidism) or due to attack on the thyroid by the immune system.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>Gastrointestinal</div><br><div>
</div><div>Down syndrome increases the risk of Hirschsprung's disease, in which the nerve cells that control the function of parts of the colon are not present. This results in severe constipation. Other congenital anomalies occurring more frequently in DS include duodenal atresia, annular pancreas, and imperforate anus. Gastroesophageal reflux disease and celiac disease are also more common among people with DS. 
</div><div>Eye and hearing disorders</div><br><div>
</div><div>Eye disorders are more common in people with DS. Almost half have strabismus, in which the two eyes do not move in tandem. Refractive errors requiring glasses or contacts are also common. Cataracts (opacity of the lens), keratoconus (thin, cone-shaped corneas), and glaucoma (increased eye pressures) are also more common in DS. Brushfield spots (small white or grayish/brown spots on the periphery of the iris) may be present.</div><br><div>
</div><div>In general hearing impairment and otological problems are found in 38-78% of children with Down syndrome compared to 2.5% for normal children. However, attentive diagnosis and aggressive treatment of chronic ear disease (e.g. otitis media, also known as glue-ear) in children with Down syndrome, can bring approximately 98% of the children up to normal hearing levels. The elevated occurrence of hearing loss for individuals with Down is not surprising. Every component in the auditory system is potentially adversely affected by Down syndrome.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>Otitis media with effusion is the most common cause of hearing loss in Down children, the infections start at birth and continue throughout the children’s lives. The ear infections are mainly associated with Eustachian tube dysfunction due to alterations in the skull base. However, excessive accumulation of wax can also cause obstruction of the outer ear canal as it is often narrowed in children with Down syndrome. Middle ear problems account for 83% of hearing loss in children with Down syndrome.  It is always important to rule out hearing loss as a contributing factor in social and mental deterioration. 
</div><div>Other complications</div><br><div>
</div><div>Instability of the atlanto-axial joint occurs in approximately 15% of people with DS, probably due to ligament laxity. It may lead to the neurologic symptoms of spinal cord compression. 
</div><div>Genetics</div><br><div>
</div><div>Down syndrome disorders are based on having too many copies of the genes located on chromosome 21. In general, this leads to an over expression of the genes. Understanding the genes involved may help to target medical treatment to individuals with Down syndrome. It is estimated that chromosome 21 contains 200 to 250 genes.  a region of the chromosome that contains the main genes responsible for the pathogenesis of Down syndrome.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>The extra chromosomal material can come about in several distinct ways. A typical human karyotype is designated as 46,XX or 46,XY, indicating 46 chromosomes with an XX arrangement typical of females and 46 chromosomes with an XY arrangement typical of males. In 1–2% of the observed Down syndromes. Some of the cells in the body are normal and other cells have trisomy 21, this is called mosaic Down syndrome (46, XX/47, XX,+21</div><br><div>
</div><div>Trisomy 21</div><br><div>
</div><div>Trisomy 21 (47,XX,+21) is caused by a meiotic nondisjunction event. With nondisjunction, a gamete (i.e., a sperm or egg cell) is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 21; the gamete thus has 24 chromosomes. When combined with a normal gamete from the other parent, the embryo now has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 21. Trisomy 21 is the cause of approximately 95% of observed Down syndromes, with 88% coming from nondisjunction in the maternal gamete and 8% coming from nondisjunction in the paternal gamete. 
</div><div>Robertsonian translocation</div><br><div>
</div><div>The extra chromosome 21 material that causes Down syndrome may be due to a Robertsonian translocation in the karyotype of one of the parents. In this case, the long arm of chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome, often chromosome 14 [45,XX, A person with such a translocation is phenotypically normal. During reproduction, normal disjunctions leading to gametes have a significant chance of creating a gamete with an extra chromosome 21, producing a child with Down syndrome. Translocation Down syndrome is often referred to as familial Down syndrome.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>Prenatal testing</div><br><div>
</div><div>Many standard prenatal screens can discover Down syndrome. Genetic counseling along with genetic testing, such as amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), or percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling (PUBS) can be offered to families who may have an increased chance of having a child with Down syndrome, or where normal prenatal exams indicate possible problems.
</div><div>Noninvasive screening tests asses the risk of Down syndrome. Such tests include blood tests; the nuchal translucency test; and other ultrasound screens which look for certain abnormal features ('markers') in the fetus (such as absent nasal bone for example).</div><br><div> 
</div><div>A non-invasive prenatal test, MaterniT21, detected Down syndrome based on fetal DNA in a sample of the mother's blood</div><br><div> 
</div><div>Management</div><br><div>
</div><div>Management stratergies such as Early childhood intervention, screening for common problems, medical treatment where indicated, a conducive family environment, and vocational training can improve the overall development of children with Down syndrome. Education and proper care will improve quality of life significantly.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>Plastic surgery</div><br><div>
</div><div>Plastic surgery has sometimes been advocated and performed on children with Down syndrome, based on the assumption that surgery can reduce the facial features associated with Down syndrome, therefore decreasing social stigma, and leading to a better quality of life. Plastic surgery on children with Down syndrome is uncommon, and continues to be controversial. For partial glossectomy (tongue reduction), one researcher found that 1 out of 3 patients "achieved oral competence," with 2 out of 3 showing speech improvement  
</div><div>Cognitive development
</div><div>Individuals with Down syndrome differ considerably in their language and communication skills. It is routine to screen for middle ear problems and hearing loss; low gain hearing aids or other amplification devices can be useful for language learning. Early communication intervention fosters linguistic skills.. Individualized speech therapy can target specific speech errors, increase speech intelligibility, and in some cases encourage advanced language and literacy. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) methods, such as pointing, body language, objects, or graphics are often used to aid communication. Relatively little research has focused on the effectiveness of communications intervention strategies
</div><div>. Children with Down syndrome may benefit from mainstreaming (whereby students of differing abilities are placed in classes with their chronological peers) provided that some adjustments are made to the curriculum. 
</div><div>
</div><div>World Down Syndrome Day
</div><div>The first World Down Syndrome Day (WDSD) was held on 21 March 2006. The day and month were chosen to correspond with 21 and trisomy respectively. It was proclaimed by European Down Syndrome Association during their European congress in Palma de Mallorca (February 2005). In the United States, the National Down Syndrome Society observes Down Syndrome Month every October as "a forum for dispelling stereotypes, providing accurate information, and raising awareness of the potential of individuals with Down syndrome."

</div><div>&nbsp;ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA
</div><div>Esophageal atresia (or Oesophageal atresia) is a congenital medical condition (birth defect) which affects the alimentary tract. It causes the esophagus to end in a blind-ended pouch rather than connecting normally to the stomach. It comprises a variety of congenital anatomic defects that are caused by an abnormal embryological development of the esophagus. It is characterized anatomically by a congenital obstruction of the esophagus with interruption of the continuity of the esophageal wall.
</div><div>Incidence   It occurs in approximately 1 in 4425 live births. Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) represents an abnormal opening between the trachea and esophagus. EA and TEF can occur separately or together. EA and TEF are diagnosed in the ICU (intensive care unit) at birth and treated immediately.
</div><div>The presence of EA is suspected in an infant with excessive salivation (drooling) and in a newborn with drooling that is frequently accompanied by choking, coughing and sneezing. When fed, these infants swallow normally but begin to cough and struggle as the fluid returns through the nose and mouth. The infant may become cyanotic (turn bluish due to lack of oxygen) and may stop breathing as the overflow of fluid from the blind pouch is aspirated (sucked into) the trachea. The cyanosis is a result of laryngospasm (a protective mechanism that the body has to prevent aspiration into the trachea). Over time respiratory distress will develop.
</div><div>If any of the above signs/symptoms are noticed, a catheter is gently passed into the esophagus to check for resistance. If resistance is noted, other studies will be done to confirm the diagnosis. A catheter can be inserted and will show up as white on a regular x-ray film to demonstrate the blind pouch ending. Sometimes a small amount of barium (chalk-like liquid) is placed through the mouth to diagnose the problems.
</div><div>It’s very commonly seen in a newborn with imperforate anus.
</div><div>Types
</div><div>This condition takes several different forms, often involving one or more fistulas connecting the trachea to the esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Approximately 85% of affected babies will have a 'lower fistula'.
</div><div>This birth defect arises in the fourth fetal week, when the trachea and esophagus should begin to separate from each other. It can be associated with disorders of the tracheoesophageal septum. 
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Associations
</div><div>Other birth defects may co-exist, particularly in the heart, but sometimes also in the anus, spinal column, or kidneys. This is known as VACTERL association because of the involvement of Vertebral column, Anorectal, Cardiac, Tracheal, Esophageal, Renal, and Limbs. It is associated with polyhydramnios in the third trimester.
</div><div>Diagnosis
</div><div>This condition is visible, after about 26 weeks, on an ultrasound. On antenatal USG, the finding of an absent or small stomach in the setting of polyhydramnios used to be considered suspicious of esophageal atresia. However, these findings have a low positive predictive value. The upper neck pouch sign is another sign that helps in the antenatal diagnosis of esophageal atresia and it may be detected soon after birth as the affected infant will be unable to swallow its own saliva. Also, the newborn can present with gastric distention, cough, apnea, tachypnea, and cyanosis. In many types of esophageal atresia, a feeding tube will not pass through the esophagus.
</div><div>Complications
</div><div>Any attempt at feeding could cause aspiration pneumonia as the milk collects in the blind pouch and overflows into the trachea and lungs. Furthermore, a fistula between the lower esophagus and trachea may allow stomach acid to flow into the lungs and cause damage. Because of these dangers, the condition must be treated as soon as possible after birth.
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>Treatments for the condition vary depending on its severity. The most immediate and effective treatment in the majority of cases is a surgical repair to close the fistula/s and reconnect the two ends of the esophagus to each other. This is not possible in all cases, since the gap between upper and lower esophageal segments may be too long to bridge. 
</div><div>In many of these so-called long gap cases, though, an advanced surgical treatment developed by John Foker, MD, may be utilized to elongate and then join together the short esophageal segments. Using the Foker technique, surgeons place traction sutures in the tiny esophageal ends and increase the tension on these sutures daily until the ends are close enough to be sewn together. The result is a normally functioning esophagus, virtually indistinguishable from one congenitally well formed. 
</div><div>Treatment of EA and TEF is surgery to repair the defect. If EA or TEF is suspected, all oral feedings are stopped and intravenous fluids are started. The infant will be positioned to help drain secretions and decrease the likelihood of aspiration. Babies with EA may sometimes have other problems. Studies should be done to look at the heart and spine kidneys.
</div><div>Surgery to fix EA is rarely an emergency. Once the baby is in condition for surgery, an incision is made on the side of the chest. The esophagus can usually be sewn together. Following surgery, the baby may be hospitalized for a variable length of time. Care for each infant is individualized.
</div><div>Traditional surgical approaches include gastrostomy, gastric pull-up, colonic transposition and jejunum transposition, although these carry some disadvantages
</div><div>Gastrostomy, or G-tube, allows for tube feedings into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Often a cervical esophagostomy will also be done, to allow the saliva which is swallowed to drain out a hole in the neck. Months or years later, the esophagus may be repaired, sometimes by using a segment of bowel brought up into the chest, interposing between the upper and lower segments of esophagus.
</div><div>Post operative complications sometimes arise, including a leak at the site of closure of the esophagus. Sometimes a stricture, or tight spot, will develop in the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow. This can usually be dilated using medical instruments. In later life, most children with this disorder will have some trouble with either swallowing or heartburn or both.
</div><div>Tracheomalacia -- a softening of the trachea, usually above the carina (carina of trachea), but sometimes extensive in the lower bronchial tree as well—is another possible serious complication. Even after esophageal repair (anastomosis) the relative flaccidity of former proximal pouch (blind pouch, above) along with esophageal dysmotility can cause fluid buildup during feeding. Owing to proximity, pouch ballooning can cause tracheal occlusion. Severe hypoxia ("dying spells") follows and medical intervention can often be required.
</div><div>A variety of treatments for tracheomalacia associated with esophageal atresia are available. If not severe, the condition can be managed expectantly since the trachea will usually stiffen as the infant matures into the first year of life. When only the trachea above the carina is compromised, one of the "simplest" interventions is aortopexy wherein the aortic loop is attached to the rear of the sternum, thereby mechanically relieving pressure from the softened trachea. An even simpler intervention is stenting. However, epithelial cell proliferation and potential incorporation of the stent into the trachea can make subsequent removal dangerous.

</div><div>
</div><div>PYLORIC STENOSIS
</div><div>
</div><div>Pyloric stenosis (or infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis) is a condition that causes severe projectile non-bilious vomiting in the first few months of life. There is narrowing (stenosis) of the opening from the stomach to the first part of the small intestine known as the duodenum, due to enlargement (hypertrophy) of the muscle surrounding this opening (the pylorus, meaning "gate"), which spasms when the stomach empties. This hypertrophy is felt classically as an olive-shaped mass in the middle upper part or right upper quadrant of the infant's abdomen. In pyloric stenosis, it is uncertain whether there is a real congenital narrowing or whether there is a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. This condition typically develops in male babies in the first 2–6 weeks of life.
</div><div>Pyloric stenosis also occurs in adults where the cause is usually a narrowed pylorus due to scarring from chronic peptic ulceration. This is a different condition from the infantile form.
</div><div>Signs and symptoms
</div><div>Babies with this condition usually present any time in the first weeks to months of life with progressively worsening vomiting. The vomiting is often described as non-bile stained ("non bilious") and "projectile vomiting", because it is more forceful than the usual spittiness (gastroesophageal reflux) seen at this age. Some infants present with poor feeding and weight loss, but others demonstrate normal weight gain. Dehydration also can occur causing the baby to cry without having tears, and having less wet or dirty nappies such as going hours or a couple days without having anything. Constant hunger, belching, and colic are other possible signs as the baby is not able to eat properly.
</div><div>Diagnosis
</div><div>Diagnosis is via a careful history and physical examination, often supplemented by radiographic studies. There should be suspicion for pyloric stenosis in any young infant with severe vomiting. On exam, palpation of the abdomen may reveal a mass in the epigastrium. This mass, which consists of the enlarged pylorus, is referred to as the 'olive', and is sometimes evident after the infant is given formula to drink. It is an elusive diagnostic skill requiring much patience and experience. There are often palpable (or even visible) peristaltic waves due to the stomach trying to force its contents past the narrowed pyloric outlet.
</div><div>Most cases of pyloric stenosis are diagnosed/confirmed with ultrasound, if available, showing the thickened pylorus. Although somewhat less useful, an upper GI series (x-rays taken after the baby drinks a special contrast agent) can be diagnostic by showing the narrowed pyloric outlet filled with a thin stream of contrast material; a "string sign" or the "railroad track sign". For either type of study, there are specific measurement criteria used to identify the abnormal results. Plain x-rays of the abdomen are not useful, except when needed to rule out other problems.
</div><div>Blood tests will reveal hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to loss of gastric acid (which contain hydrochloric acid and potassium) via persistent vomiting; these findings can be seen with severe vomiting from any cause. The potassium is decreased further by the body's release of aldosterone, in an attempt to compensate for the hypovolaemia due to the severe vomiting.
</div><div>Pathophysiology
</div><div>The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. The exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown.
</div><div>&nbsp;The vomited material does not contain bile because the pyloric obstruction prevents entry of duodenal contents (containing bile) into the stomach.
</div><div>This results in loss of gastric acid (hydrochloric acid). The chloride loss results in hypochloremia which impairs the kidney's ability to excrete bicarbonate. This is the significant factor that prevents correction of the alkalosis.
</div><div>&nbsp;A secondary hyperaldosteronism develops due to the hypovolemia. The high aldosterone levels causes the kidneys to avidly retain Na+ (to correct the intravascular volume depletion), and excrete increased amounts of K+ into the urine (resulting in hypokalaemia).
</div><div>The body's compensatory response to the metabolic alkalosis is hypoventilation resulting in an elevated arterial pCO2.
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>Infantile pyloric stenosis is typically managed with surgery; very few cases are mild enough to be treated medically.
</div><div>The danger of pyloric stenosis comes from the dehydration and electrolyte disturbance rather than the underlying problem itself. Therefore, the baby must be initially stabilized by correcting the dehydration and hypochloremic alkalosis with IV fluids. This can usually be accomplished in about 24–48 hours.
</div><div>Intravenous and oral atropine may be used to treat pyloric stenosis. It has a success rate of 85-89% compared to nearly 100% for pyloromyotomy, however it requires prolonged hospitalization, skilled nursing and careful follow up during treatment. It might be an alternative to surgery in children who have contraindications for anesthesia or surgery.

</div><div>The definitive treatment of pyloric stenosis is with surgical pyloromyotomy known as Ramstedt's procedure (dividing the muscle of the pylorus to open up the gastric outlet). This is a relatively straightforward surgery that can possibly be done through a single incision (usually 3–4 cm long) or laparoscopically (through several tiny incisions), depending on the surgeon's experience and preference.
</div><div>&nbsp;Some vomiting may be expected during the first days after surgery as the gastro-intestinal tract settles. Very occasionally the myotomy was incomplete and projectile vomiting continues, requiring repeat surgery. But the condition generally has no long term side-effects or impact on the child's future.
</div><div>Epidemiology
</div><div>Males are more commonly affected than females, with firstborn males affected about four times as often, and there is a genetic predisposition for the disease 
</div><div>Babies with blood type B or O are more likely than other types to be affected. 
</div><div>Infants exposed to erythromycin are at increased risk for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, especially when the drug is taken around two weeks of life.

</div><div>HYDROCEPHALUS
</div><div>It is also known as "water in the brain," is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles, or cavities, of the brain. This may cause increased intracranial pressure inside the skull and progressive enlargement of the head, convulsion, tunnel vision, and mental disability. Hydrocephalus can also cause death. The name derives from the Greek words (hydro-) "water", and (kephalos) "head".
</div><div>
</div><div>Signs and symptoms
</div><div>The clinical presentation of hydrocephalus varies with chronicity. Acute dilatation of the ventricular system is more likely to manifest with the nonspecific signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure
</div><div>Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure may include headaches, vomiting, nausea, papilloedema, sleepiness or coma. 
</div><div>&nbsp;urinary incontinence and dementia is a relatively typical manifestation of the distinct entity normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Focal neurological deficits may also occur, such as abductions nerve palsy and vertical gaze palsy (Parinaud syndrome due to compression of the quadrigeminal plate, where the neural centers coordinating the conjugated vertical eye movement are located). The symptoms depend on the cause of the blockage, the person's age, and how much brain tissue has been damaged by the swelling.
</div><div>In infants with hydrocephalus, CSF builds up in the central nervous system, causing the fontanelle (soft spot) to bulge and the head to be larger than expected. Early symptoms may also include
</div><div>An infant with severe hydrocephalus.
</div><div>•	Eyes that appear to gaze downward
</div><div>•	Irritability
</div><div>•	Seizures
</div><div>•	Separated sutures
</div><div>•	Sleepiness
</div><div>•	Vomiting
</div><div>Symptoms that may occur in older children can include:
</div><div>•	Brief, shrill, high-pitched cry
</div><div>•	Changes in personality, memory, or the ability to reason or think
</div><div>•	Changes in facial appearance and eye spacing
</div><div>•	Crossed eyes or uncontrolled eye movements
</div><div>•	Difficulty feeding
</div><div>•	Excessive sleepiness
</div><div>•	Headache
</div><div>•	Irritability, poor temper control
</div><div>•	Loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence)
</div><div>•	Loss of coordination and trouble walking
</div><div>•	Muscle spasticity (spasm)
</div><div>•	Slow growth (child 0–5 years)
</div><div>•	Slow or restricted movement
</div><div>•	Vomiting
</div><div>&nbsp;“The skull of a newborn baby is often full of liquid, either because the matron has compressed it excessively or for other, unknown reasons. The volume of the skull then increases daily, so that the bones of the skull fail to close. In this case, we must open the middle of the skull in three places, make the liquid flow out, then close the wound and tighten the skull with a bandage.”
</div><div>Hydrocephalus is usually due to blockage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow in the ventricles or in the subarachnoid space over the brain. In a person without hydrocephalus, CSF continuously circulates through the brain, its ventricles and the spinal cord and is continuously drained away into the circulatory system. Alternatively, the condition may result from an overproduction of the CSF, from a congenital malformation blocking normal drainage of the fluid, or from complications of head injuries or infections. Compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually may cause neurological symptoms such as convulsions, mental retardation and epileptic seizures. These signs occur sooner in adults, whose skulls are no longer able to expand to accommodate the increasing fluid volume within. Fetuses, infants, and young children with hydrocephalus typically have an abnormally large head, excluding the face, because the pressure of the fluid causes the individual skull bones — which have yet to fuse — to bulge outward at their juncture points. Another medical sign, in infants, is a characteristic fixed downward gaze with whites of the eyes showing above the iris, as though the infant were trying to examine its own lower eyelids.
</div><div>If the foramina of the fourth ventricle or the cerebral aqueduct are blocked, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can accumulate within the ventricles. This condition is called internal hydrocephalus and it results in increased CSF pressure. The production of CSF continues, even when the passages that normally allow it to exit the brain are blocked. Consequently, fluid builds inside the brain causing pressure that dilates the ventricles and compresses the nervous tissue. Compression of the nervous tissue usually results in irreversible brain damage. If the skull bones are not completely ossified when the hydrocephalus occurs, the pressure may also severely enlarge the head. The cerebral aqueduct may be blocked at the time of birth or may become blocked later in life because of a tumor growing in the brainstem.
</div><div>Internal hydrocephalus can be successfully treated by placing a drainage tube (shunt) between the brain ventricles and abdominal cavity to eliminate the high intracranial pressure. There is some risk of infection being introduced into the brain through these shunts, however, and the shunts must be replaced as the person grows. A subarachnoid hemorrhage may block the return of CSF to the circulation.
</div><div>This should be distinguished from external hydrocephalus. This is a condition generally seen in infants and involving enlarged fluid spaces or subarachnoid spaces around the outside of the brain. This is generally a benign condition that resolves spontaneously by 2 years of age. (Greenberg, Handbook of Neurosurgery, 5th Edition, pg 174). [7] Imaging studies and a good medical history can help to differentiate external hydrocephalus from subdural hemorrhages or symptomatic chronic extra-axial fluid collections which are accompanied by vomiting, headaches and seizures.
</div><div>Classification
</div><div>Hydrocephalus can be caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, reabsorption, or excessive CSF production.
</div><div>•	The most common cause of hydrocephalus is CSF flow obstruction, hindering the free passage of cerebrospinal fluid through the ventricular system and subarachnoid space (e.g., stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct or obstruction of the interventricular foramina - foramina of Monro secondary to tumors, hemorrhages, infections or congenital malformations).
</div><div>•	Hydrocephalus can also be caused by overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid (relative obstruction) (e.g., papilloma of choroid plexus).
</div><div>Based on its underlying mechanisms, hydrocephalus can be classified into communicating and non-communicating (obstructive). Both forms can be either congenital or acquired.
</div><div>Communicating
</div><div>Communicating hydrocephalus, also known as non-obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid resorption in the absence of any CSF-flow obstruction between the ventricles and subarachnoid space. It has been theorized that this is due to functional impairment of the arachnoidal granulations (also called arachnoid granulations or Pacchioni's granulations), which are located along the superior sagittal sinus and is the site of cerebrospinal fluid resorption back into the venous system. Various neurologic conditions may result in communicating hydrocephalus, including subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage, meningitis and congenital absence of arachnoid villi. Scarring and fibrosis of the subarachnoid space following infectious, inflammatory, or hemorrhagic events can also prevent resorption of CSF, causing diffuse ventricular dilatation.
</div><div>•	Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a particular form of communicating hydrocephalus, characterized by enlarged cerebral ventricles, with only intermittently elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The diagnosis of NPH can be established only with the help of continuous intraventricular pressure recordings (over 24 hours or even longer), since more often than not instant measurements yield normal pressure values. Dynamic compliance studies may be also helpful. Altered compliance (elasticity) of the ventricular walls, as well as increased viscosity of the cerebrospinal fluid, may play a role in the pathogenesis of normal pressure hydrocephalus.
</div><div>•	Hydrocephalus ex vacuo also refers to an enlargement of cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, and is usually due to brain atrophy (as it occurs in dementias), post-traumatic brain injuries and even in some psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. As opposed to hydrocephalus, this is a compensatory enlargement of the CSF-spaces in response to brain parenchyma loss - it is not the result of increased CSF pressure.
</div><div>Non-communicating
</div><div>Non-communicating hydrocephalus, or obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by a CSF-flow obstruction ultimately preventing CSF from flowing into the subarachnoid space (either due to external compression or intraventricular mass lesions).
</div><div>•	Foramen of Monro obstruction may lead to dilation of one or, if large enough (e.g., in Colloid cyst), both lateral ventricles.
</div><div>•	The aqueduct of Sylvius, normally narrow to begin with, may be obstructed by a number of genetically or acquired lesions (e.g., atresia, ependymitis, hemorrhage, tumor) and lead to dilation of both lateral ventricles as well as the third ventricle.
</div><div>•	Fourth ventricle obstruction will lead to dilatation of the aqueduct as well as the lateral and third ventricles (e.g., Chiari malformation).
</div><div>•	The foramina of Luschka and foramen of Magendie may be obstructed due to congenital failure of opening (e.g., Dandy-Walker malformation).
</div><div>Congenital
</div><div>: Arnold-Chiari malformation and Dandy-Walker malformation
</div><div>The cranial bones fuse by the end of the third year of life. For head enlargement to occur, hydrocephalus must occur before then. The causes are usually genetic but can also be acquired and usually occur within the first few months of life, which include 1) intraventricular matrix hemorrhages in premature infants, 2) infections, 3) type II Arnold-Chiari malformation, 4) aqueduct atresia and stenosis, and 5) Dandy-Walker malformation.
</div><div>In newborns and toddlers with hydrocephalus, the head circumference is enlarged rapidly and soon surpasses the 97th percentile. Since the skull bones have not yet firmly joined together, bulging, firm anterior and posterior fontanelles may be present even when the patient is in an upright position.
</div><div>The infant exhibits fretfulness, poor feeding, and frequent vomiting. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor sets in, and the infant shows lack of interest in his surroundings. Later on, the upper eyelids become retracted and the eyes are turned downwards (due to hydrocephalic pressure on the mesencephalic tegmentum and paralysis of upward gaze). Movements become weak and the arms may become tremulous. Papilledema is absent but there may be reduction of vision. The head becomes so enlarged that the child may eventually be bedridden.
</div><div>About 80-90% of fetuses or newborn infants with spina bifida—often associated with meningocele or myelomeningocele—develop hydrocephalus. 
</div><div>Acquired
</div><div>This condition is acquired as a consequence of CNS infections, meningitis, brain tumors, head trauma, intracranial hemorrhage (subarachnoid or intraparenchymal) and is usually extremely painful.
</div><div>Effects
</div><div>Because hydrocephalus can injure the brain, thought and behavior may be adversely affected. Learning disabilities including short-term memory loss are common among those with hydrocephalus, who tend to score better on verbal IQ than on performance IQ, which is thought to reflect the distribution of nerve damage to the brain. However the severity of hydrocephalus can differ considerably between individuals and some are of average or above-average intelligence. Someone with hydrocephalus may have motion and visual problems, problems with coordination, or may be clumsy. They may reach puberty earlier than the average child (see precocious puberty). About one in four develops epilepsy.
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>Hydrocephalus treatment is surgical, generally creating various types of cerebral shunts. It involves the placement of a ventricular catheter (a tube made of silastic), into the cerebral ventricles to bypass the flow obstruction/malfunctioning arachnoidal granulations and drain the excess fluid into other body cavities, from where it can be resorbed. Most shunts drain the fluid into the peritoneal cavity (ventriculo-peritoneal shunt), but alternative sites include the right atrium (ventriculo-atrial shunt), pleural cavity (ventriculo-pleural shunt), and gallbladder. A shunt system can also be placed in the lumbar space of the spine and have the CSF redirected to the peritoneal cavity (Lumbar-peritoneal shunt). An alternative treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus in selected patients is the endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), whereby a surgically created opening in the floor of the third ventricle allows the CSF to flow directly to the basal cisterns, thereby shortcutting any obstruction, as in aqueductal stenosis. This may or may not be appropriate based on individual anatomy.
</div><div>Shunt complications
</div><div>Examples of possible complications include shunt malfunction, shunt failure, and shunt infection, along with infection of the shunt tract following surgery (the most common reason for shunt failure is infection of the shunt tract). Although a shunt generally works well, it may stop working if it disconnects, becomes blocked (clogged), infected, or it is outgrown. If this happens the cerebrospinal fluid will begin to accumulate again and a number of physical symptoms will develop (headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia/light sensitivity), some extremely serious, like seizures. The shunt failure rate is also relatively high (of the 40,000 surgeries performed annually to treat hydrocephalus, only 30% are a patient's first surgery) and it is not uncommon for patients to have multiple shunt revisions within their lifetime.
</div><div>Another complication can occur when CSF drains more rapidly than it is produced by the choroid plexus, causing symptoms -listlessness, severe headaches, irritability, light sensitivity, auditory hyperesthesia (sound sensitivity), nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, migraines, seizures, a change in personality, weakness in the arms or legs, strabismus, and double vision - to appear when the patient is vertical. If the patient lies down, the symptoms usually vanish in a short amount of time. A CT scan may or may not show any change in ventricle size, particularly if the patient has a history of slit-like ventricles. Difficulty in diagnosing over drainage can make treatment of this complication particularly frustrating for patients and their families.
</div><div>Resistance to traditional analgesic pharmacological therapy may also be a sign of shunt overdrainage or failure. Diagnosis of the particular complication usually depends on when the symptoms appear - that is, whether symptoms occur when the patient is upright or in a prone position, with the head at roughly the same level as the feet.

</div><div>TOXIC MEGACOLON
</div><div>Toxic megacolon (megacolon toxicum) is an acute form of colonic distension It is characterized by a very dilated colon (megacolon), accompanied by abdominal distension (bloating), and sometimes fever, abdominal pain, or shock. 
</div><div>Megacolon is an abnormal dilation of the colon (a part of the large intestines). The dilatation is often accompanied by a paralysis of the peristaltic movements of the bowel. In more extreme cases, the feces consolidate into hard masses inside the colon, called fecalomas (literally, fecal tumor), which can require surgery to be removed.
</div><div>A human colon is considered abnormally enlarged if it has a diameter greater than 12 cm in the cecum (it is normally less than 9 cm) greater than 6.5 cm in the rectosigmoid region and greater than 8 cm for the ascending colon. The transverse colon is usually less than 6 cm in diameter. 
</div><div>A megacolon can be either acute or chronic. It can also be classified according to etiology. 
</div><div>Toxic megacolon is usually a complication of inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and, more rarely, Crohn’s disease, and of some infections of the colon, including Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infections which have led to pseudomembranous colitis. Other forms of megacolon exist and can be congenital (present since birth, such as Hirschsprung's disease). Also can be caused by Entamoeba histolytica.
</div><div>
</div><div>Signs and symptoms
</div><div>•	Abdominal pain
</div><div>•	Abdominal bloating
</div><div>•	Abdominal tenderness
</div><div>•	Fever
</div><div>•	Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
</div><div>•	Dehydration
</div><div>•	 constipation 
</div><div>•	tympany, 
</div><div>•	 palpation of hard fecal masses 
</div><div>•	 low blood potassium, 
</div><div>•	shock. 
</div><div>•	Stercoral ulcers are sometimes observed in chronic megacolon, which may lead to perforation of the intestinal wall in approximately 3% of the cases, leading to sepsis and risk of death.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>•	There may be signs of septic shock. A physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness and possible loss of bowel sounds. An abdominal radiography shows colonic dilation. There is usually an elevated white blood cell count. Severe sepsis may present with hypothermia or leukopenia. Congenital or aganglionic megacolon
</div><div>Cause
</div><div>•	Acquired megacolon, of which there are several possible etiologies: 
</div><div>o	Idiopathic megacolon
</div><div>o	Toxic megacolon
</div><div>o	Megacolon secondary to infection 
</div><div>	Clostridium Difficile
</div><div>o	Other neurologic, systemic and metabolic diseases
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Medication 
</div><div>Aganglionic megacolon
</div><div>Also called Hirschsprung's disease, it is a congenital disorder of the colon in which nerve cells of the myenteric or Auerbach's plexus in its walls, also known as ganglion cells, are absent. It is a rare disorder (1:5 000), with prevalence among males being four times that of females. Hirschsprung’s disease develops in the fetus during the early stages of pregnancy. The exact genetic cause remains unsolved, although in familial cases (in which families have multiple affected patients), it seems to exhibit autosomal dominant transmission, with a gene called RET, in chromosome 10, being dominant. Seven other genes seem to be implicated, however. If untreated, the patient can develop enterocolitis.
</div><div>Medication
</div><div>Risperidone, an anti-psychotic medication, can result in megacolon.
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>•	The objective of treatment is to decompress the bowel and to prevent swallowed air from further distending the bowel. If decompression is not achieved or the patient does not improve within 24 hours, a colectomy (surgical removal of all or part of the colon) is indicated. Fluid and electrolyte replacement help to prevent dehydration and shock. Use of corticosteroids may be indicated to suppress the inflammatory reaction in the colon if megacolon has resulted from active inflammatory bowel disease. Antibiotics may be given to prevent sepsis. In stable cases, use of laxatives and bulking agents, as well as modifications in diet and stool habits are effective.
</div><div>•	Corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medication is used in toxic megacolon.
</div><div>•	Antibiotics are used for bacterial infections such as Vancomycin for Clostridium Difficile
</div><div>•	Disimpaction of feces and decompression using anorectal and nasogastric tubes.
</div><div>•	When megacolon worsens and the conservative measures fail to restore transit, surgery may be necessary.
</div><div>There are several surgical approaches to treat megacolon, such as a colectomy (removal of the entire colon) with ileorectal anastomosis (ligation of the remaining ileus and rectum segments), or a total proctocolectomy (removal of colon, sigmoid and rectum) followed by ileostomy or followed by ileoanal anastomosis.
</div><div>
</div><div>Prognosis
</div><div>If the condition does not improve, there is a significant risk of death. In case of poor response to conservative therapy a colectomy is usually required. This may involve all or part of the colon being removed, with the resulting option of anastomosis or ileostomy. Ileostomy carries far less risk of infection and post-operative complications because the risk of deterioration of sutures within the intestinal tract (as a result of anastomosis) is not present. The risk of death and shock has been reported to be lower in children, however most children required colectomy in one case-control study. 
</div><div>Complications
</div><div>•	Sepsis
</div><div>•	Shock
</div><div>•	Perforation of the colon 
</div><div>•	Emergency action may be required if severe abdominal pain develops -- particularly if it is accompanied by fever, rapid heart rate, tenderness when the abdomen is pressed, bloody diarrhea, frequent diarrhea, or painful bowel movements.
</div><div>Colonoscopy is contra-indicated, as it may rupture the dilated colon resulting in peritonitis and septic shock

</div><div>Toxic megacolon
</div><div>Main article: Toxic megacolon
</div><div>Toxic megacolon is mainly seen in ulcerative colitis and pseudomembranous colitis, two chronic inflammations of the colon. Its mechanism is incompletely understood. It is probably due to an excessive production of nitric oxide, at least in ulcerative colitis. The prevalence is about the same for both sexes.
</div><div>] Chagas disease
</div><div>Megacolon can be associated with Chagas disease. In Central and South America, the most common incidence of chronic megacolon is that observed in ca. 20% of patients affected with Chagas disease. Chagas is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a flagellate protozoan transmitted by the feces of a hematophagous insect, the assassin bug, when it feeds. Chagas can also be acquired congenitally, through blood transfusion or organ transplant, and rarely through contaminated food (for example garapa). There are several theories on how megacolon (and also megaesophagus) develops in Chagas disease. The Austrian-Brazilian physician and pathologist Fritz Köberle was the first to propose a coherent hypothesis based on the documented destruction of the Auerbach's plexus in the walls of the intestinal tracts of Chagas patients, the so-called neurogenic hypothesis. In this, the destruction of the autonomic nervous system innervation of the colon leads to a loss of the normal smooth muscle tone of the wall and subsequent gradual dilation. His research proved that, by extensively quantifying the number of neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the Auerbach's plexus, that: 1) they were strongly reduced all over the digestive tract; 2) that megacolon appeared only when there was a reduction of over 80% of the number of neurons 3) these pathologies appeared as a result of the disruption of the neurally integrated control of peristalsis (muscular annular contraction) in those parts where a strong force is necessary to impel the luminal bolus of feces; and 4) Idiopathic megacolon and Chagas megacolon appear to have the same etiology, namely the degeneration of the Auerbach's myoenteric plexus.
</div><div>Why T. cruzi causes the destruction, however, remains to be elucidated: there are evidences for the presence of specific neurotoxins as well as a disordely immune system reaction.
</div><div>Diagnosis
</div><div>Diagnosis is achieved mainly by plain and contrasted radiographical and ultrasound imaging. Colonic marker transit studies are useful to distinguish colonic inertia from functional outlet obstruction etiologies. In this test, the patient swallows a water soluble bolus of radio-opaque contrast and films are obtained 1, 3 and 5 days later. Patients with colonic inertia show the marker spread throughout the large intestines, while patients with outlet obstruction exhibit slow accumulations of markers in some places. A colonoscopy can also be used to rule out mechanical obstructive causes. Anorectal manometry may help to differentiate acquired from congenital forms. Rectal biopsy is recommended to make a final diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.

</div><div>CLEFT LIP AND PALATE
</div><div>Cleft lip (cheiloschisis) and cleft palate (palatoschisis), which can also occur together as cleft lip and palate, are variations of a type of clefting congenital deformity caused by abnormal facial development during gestation. A cleft is a fissure or opening—a gap. It is the non-fusion of the body's natural structures that form before birth. Approximately 1 in 700 children born have a cleft lip and/or a cleft palate. In decades past, the condition was sometimes referred to as harelip, based on the similarity to the cleft in the lip of a hare, but that term is now generally considered to be offensive.
</div><div>Clefts can also affect other parts of the face, such as the eyes, ears, nose, cheeks, and forehead. In 1976, Paul Tessier described fifteen lines of cleft. Most of these craniofacial clefts are even more rare and are frequently described as Tessier clefts using the numerical locator devised by Tessier
</div><div>A cleft lip or palate can be successfully treated with surgery, especially so if conducted soon after birth or in early childhood.
</div><div>Signs and symptoms
</div><div>Cleft lip and palate
</div><div>If the cleft does not affect the palate structure of the mouth it is referred to as cleft lip. Cleft lip is formed in the top of the lip as either a small gap or an indentation in the lip (partial or incomplete cleft) or it continues into the nose (complete cleft). Lip cleft can occur as a one sided (unilateral) or two sided (bilateral). It is due to the failure of fusion of the maxillary and medial nasal processes (formation of the primary palate).
</div><div>A mild form of a cleft lip is a microform cleft. A microform cleft can appear as small as a little dent in the red part of the lip or look like a scar from the lip up to the nostril. In some cases muscle tissue in the lip underneath the scar is affected and might require reconstructive surgery. It is advised to have newborn infants with a microform cleft checked with a craniofacial team as soon as possible to determine the severity of the cleft.
</div><div>Cleft palate
</div><div>Cleft palate is a condition in which the two plates of the skull that form the hard palate (roof of the mouth) are not completely joined. The soft palate is in these cases cleft as well. In most cases, cleft lip is also present. Palate cleft can occur as complete (soft and hard palate, possibly including a gap in the jaw) or incomplete (a 'hole' in the roof of the mouth, usually as a cleft soft palate). When cleft palate occurs, the uvula is usually split. It occurs due to the failure of fusion of the lateral palatine processes, the nasal septum, and/or the median palatine processes (formation of the secondary palate).
</div><div>The hole in the roof of the mouth caused by a cleft connects the mouth directly to the nasal cavity.
</div><div>A result of an open connection between the oral cavity and nasal cavity is called velopharyngeal inadequacy (VPI). Because of the gap, air leaks into the nasal cavity resulting in a hypernasal voice resonance and nasal emissions while talking. Secondary effects of VPI include speech articulation errors (e.g., distortions, substitutions, and omissions) and compensatory misarticulations and mispronunciations (e.g., glottal stops and posterior nasal fricatives). Possible treatment options include speech therapy, prosthetics, augmentation of the posterior pharyngeal wall, lengthening of the palate, and surgical procedures. Submucous cleft palate (SMCP) can also occur, which is a cleft of the soft palate with a classic clinical triad of a bifid, or split, uvula which is found dangling in the back of the throat, a furrow along the midline of the soft palate, and a notch in the back margin of the hard palate. 
</div><div>Complications
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Cleft may cause problems with feeding, ear disease, speech and socialization.
</div><div>Due to lack of suction, an infant with a cleft may have trouble feeding. An infant with a cleft palate will have greater success feeding in a more upright position. Gravity will help prevent milk from coming through the baby's nose if he/she has cleft palate. Gravity feeding can be accomplished by using specialized equipment, such as the Haberman Feeder, or by using a combination of nipples and bottle inserts like the one shown, is commonly used with other infants. A large hole, crosscut, or slit in the nipple, a protruding nipple and rhythmically squeezing the bottle insert can result in controllable flow to the infant without the stigma caused by specialized equipment.
</div><div>Individuals with cleft also face many middle ear infections which can eventually lead to total hearing loss. The Eustachian tubes and external ear canals may be angled or tortuous, leading to food or other contamination of a part of the body that is normally self cleaning. Hearing is related to learning to speak. Babies with palatal clefts may have compromised hearing and therefore, if the baby cannot hear, it cannot try to mimic the sounds of speech. Thus, even before expressive language acquisition, the baby with the cleft palate is at risk for receptive language acquisition. Because the lips and palate are both used in pronunciation, individuals with cleft usually need the aid of a speech therapist.
</div><div>Cause
</div><div>The development of the face is coordinated by complex morphogenetic events and rapid proliferative expansion, and is thus highly susceptible to environmental and genetic factors, rationalising the high incidence of facial malformations. During the first six to eight weeks of pregnancy, the shape of the embryo's head is formed. Five primitive tissue lobes grow:
</div><div>a) One from the top of the head down towards the future upper lip; (Frontonasal Prominence)
</div><div>b-c) two from the cheeks, which meet the first lobe to form the upper lip; (Maxillar Prominence)
</div><div>d-e) and just below, two additional lobes grow from each side, which form the chin and lower lip; (Mandibular Prominence)
</div><div>If these tissues fail to meet, a gap appears where the tissues should have joined (fused). This may happen in any single joining site, or simultaneously in several or all of them. The resulting birth defect reflects the locations and severity of individual fusion failures (e.g., from a small lip or palate fissure up to a completely malformed face).
</div><div>The upper lip is formed earlier than the palate, from the first three lobes named a to c above. Formation of the palate is the last step in joining the five embryonic facial lobes, and involves the back portions of the lobes b and c. These back portions are called palatal shelves, which grow towards each other until they fuse in the middle. This process is very vulnerable to multiple toxic substances, environmental pollutants, and nutritional imbalance. The biologic mechanisms of mutual recognition of the two cabinets, and the way they are glued together, are quite complex and obscure despite intensive scientific research. 
</div><div>Genetics
</div><div>Genetic factors contributing to cleft lip and cleft palate formation have been identified for some syndromic cases, but knowledge about genetic factors that contribute to the more common isolated cases of cleft lip/palate is still patchy.
</div><div>Many clefts run in families, even though in some cases there does not seem to be an identifiable syndrome present possibly because of the current incomplete genetic understanding of midfacial development..
</div><div>•	Stickler's Syndrome can cause cleft lip and palate, joint pain, and myopia.
</div><div>•	 Loeys-Dietz syndrome can cause cleft palate or bifid uvula, hypertelorism, and aortic aneurysm.
</div><div>•	 Hardikar syndrome can cause cleft lip and palate, Hydronephrosis, Intestinal obstruction and other symptoms.
</div><div>•	 Cleft lip/palate may be present in many different chromosome disorders including Patau Syndrome (trisomy 13).
</div><div>•	Malpuech facial clefting syndrome
</div><div>•	Hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes
</div><div>•	Popliteal pterygium syndrome
</div><div>•	Treacher Collins Syndrome
</div><div>
</div><div>Environment
</div><div>Environmental influences may also cause, or interact with genetics to produce, orofacial clefting. An example for how environmental factors might be linked to genetics comes from research on mutations in the gene In humans, fetal cleft lip and other congenital abnormalities have also been linked to maternal hypoxia, as caused by e.g. maternal smoking, maternal alcohol abuse or some forms of maternal hypertension treatment.[36] Other environmental factors that have been studied include: seasonal causes (such as pesticide exposure); maternal diet and vitamin intake; retinoids — which are members of the vitamin A family; anticonvulsant drugs; alcohol; cigarette use; nitrate compounds; organic solvents; parental exposure to lead; and illegal drugs (cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, etc.).
</div><div>Current research continues to investigate the extent to which Folic acid can reduce the incidence of clefting. 
</div><div>Diagnosis
</div><div>Traditionally, the diagnosis is made at the time of birth by physical examination. Recent advances in prenatal diagnosis have allowed obstetricians to diagnose facial clefts inutero
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>Cleft lip and palate is very treatable; however, the kind of treatment depends on the type and severity of the cleft.
</div><div>Most children with a form of clefting are monitored by a cleft palate team or craniofacial team through young adulthood Care can be lifelong. Treatment procedures can vary between craniofacial teams. For example, some teams wait on jaw correction until the child is aged 10 to 12 (argument: growth is less influential as deciduous teeth are replaced by permanent teeth, thus saving the child from repeated corrective surgeries), while other teams correct the jaw earlier (argument: less speech therapy is needed than at a later age when speech therapy becomes harder). Within teams, treatment can differ between individual cases depending on the type and severity of the cleft
</div><div>Cleft lip
</div><div>Within the first 2–3 months after birth, surgery is performed to close the cleft lip. While surgery to repair a cleft lip can be performed soon after birth, often the preferred age is at approximately 10 weeks of age, following the "rule of 10s" coined by surgeons Wilhelmmesen and Musgrave in 1969 (the child is at least 10 weeks of age has at least 10g hemoglobin). If the cleft is bilateral and extensive, two surgeries may be required to close the cleft, one side first, and the second side a few weeks later. The most common procedure to repair a cleft lip is the Millard procedure pioneered by Ralph Millard. Millard performed the first procedure at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) unit in Korea.
</div><div>&nbsp;Often an incomplete cleft lip requires the same surgery as complete cleft. This is done for two reasons. Firstly the group of muscles required to purse the lips run through the upper lip. In order to restore the complete group a full incision must be made. Secondly, to create a less obvious scar the surgeon tries to line up the scar with the natural lines in the upper lip (such as the edges of the philtrum) and tuck away stitches as far up the nose as possible. Incomplete cleft gives the surgeon more tissue to work with, creating a more supple and natural-looking upper lip.
</div><div>Pre-surgical devices
</div><div>In some cases of a severe bi-lateral complete cleft, the premaxillary segment will be protruded far outside the mouth.
</div><div>Nasoalveolar molding prior to surgery can improve long-term nasal symmetry among patients with complete unilateral cleft lip-cleft palate patients compared to correction by surgery alone, according to a retrospective cohort study.[42] In this study, significant improvements in nasal symmetry were observed in multiple areas including measurements of the projected length of the nasal ala (lateral surface of the external nose), position of the superoinferior alar groove, position of the mediolateral nasal dome, and nasal bridge deviation. "The nasal ala projection length demonstrated an average ratio of 93.0 percent in the surgery-alone group and 96.5 percent in the nasoalveolar molding group" this study concluded.
</div><div>Often a cleft palate is temporarily covered by a palatal obturator (a prosthetic device made to fit the roof of the mouth covering the gap).
</div><div>Cleft palate can also be corrected by surgery, usually performed between 6 and 12 months. Approximately 20–25% only require one palatal surgery to achieve a competent velopharyngeal valve capable of producing normal, non-hypernasal speech. However, combinations of surgical methods and repeated surgeries are often necessary as the child grows. One of the new innovations of cleft lip and cleft palate repair is the Latham appliance. The Latham is surgically inserted by use of pins during the child's 4th or 5th month. After it is in place, the doctor, or parents, turn a screw daily to bring the cleft together to assist with future lip and/or palate repair.
</div><div>If the cleft extends into the maxillary alveolar ridge, the gap is usually corrected by filling the gap with bone tissue. The bone tissue can be acquired from the patients own chin, rib or hip.
</div><div>Speech and hearing
</div><div>A tympanostomy tube is often inserted into the eardrum to aerate the middle ear. This is often beneficial for the hearing ability of the child.
</div><div>Children with cleft palate typically have a variety of speech problems. Some speech problems result directly from anatomical differences such as velopharyngeal inadequacy. Velopharyngeal inadequacy refers to the inability of the soft palate to close the opening from the throat to the nasal cavity, which is necessary for many speech sounds,  This type of errors typically resolve after palate repair However, sometimes children with cleft palate also have speech errors which develop as the result of an attempt to compensate for the inability to produce the target phoneme. These are known as compensatory articulations. Compensatory articulations are usually sounds that are non-existent in normal English phonology, often do not resolve automatically after palatal repair, and make a child’s speech even more difficult to understand. Speech-language pathology can be very beneficial to help resolve speech problems associated with cleft palate. In addition, research has indicated that children who receive early language intervention are less likely to develop compensatory error patterns later. 
</div><div>Hearing loss
</div><div>Hearing impairment is particularly prevalent in children with cleft palate. The tensor muscle fibres that open the eustachian tubes lack an anchor to function effectively. In this situation, when the air in the middle ear is absorbed by the mucous membrane, the negative pressure is not compensated, which results in the secretion of fluid into the middle ear space from the mucous membrane. Children with this problem typically have a conductive hearing loss primarily caused by this middle ear effusion.

</div><div>CYSTIC HYGROMA

</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>Cystic hygromas are classically found in the posterior triangle of the neck (purple).
</div><div>A cystic hygroma (also known as cystic lymphangioma and macrocystic lymphatic malformation) is a congenital multiloculated lymphatic lesion that can arise anywhere, but is classically found in the left posterior triangle of the neck. This is the most common form of lymphangioma. It contains large cyst like cavities containing watery fluid. Microscopically cystic hygroma consists of multiple locules filled with lymph. In the depth the locules are quite big but they decrease in size towards the surface.
</div><div>Cystic hygromas are benign, but can be disfiguring. It is a condition which affects children; very rarely it can present in adulthood 
</div><div>Cystic hygroma is also known as lymphatic malformation. Nowadays, the medical field prefers to use the term lymphatic malformation because the term cystic hygroma means water tumor. Lymphatic malformation is more commonly used now because it is a sponge-like collection of abnormal growth that contains clear lymphatic fluid. The fluid collects within the cysts or channels, usually in the soft tissue. Cystic hygromas are filled with lymph which is the fluid that travels in the lymphatic system of the body. Cystic hygromas occur when the lymph vessels that make up the lymphatic system aren't formed properly.
</div><div>There are two types of lymphatic malformations. They are macrocystic lymphatic malformations (large cysts) and microcystic (small cysts). A person may have only one kind of the malformation or can have a mixture of both macro and micro cysts.
</div><div>Cystic hygroma can be associated with a nuchal lymphangioma or a fetal hydrops. Additionally, it can be associated with Turner syndrome[3] or with Noonan's syndrome.
</div><div>A lethal version of this condition is known as Cowchock Wapner Kurtz syndrome that, in addition to cystic hygroma, includes lymphedema and cleft palate. 
</div><div>Prognosis
</div><div>Cystic hygroma can be found in healthy babies or in babies born with chromosome abnormalities. The outcome is generally better for a baby that does not have a chromosome abnormality. About 60% of cystic hygromas result from chromosome abnormalities. The baby may have a set of abnormalities known as "genetic syndrome".
</div><div>Genetic syndromes with cystic hygroma as a clinical feature: • The majority of prenatally diagnosed cystic hygromas are associated with Turner syndrome, a chromosome abnormality in which a female has only one X chromosome instead of two. • Chromosome abnormalities such as trisomies 13, 18, and 21 
</div><div>Signs and Symptoms
</div><div>Cystic hygromas are increasingly diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography.
</div><div>A common symptom is a neck growth mass. It may be found at birth, or discovered later in an infant after an upper respiratory tract infection  Many cystic hygromas are usually found at birth, but some may appear after birth.
</div><div>Cystic hygromas can grow very large and may affect breathing and swallowing. The following are the most common symptoms of a lymphatic malformation. However, each child may experience symptoms differently.
</div><div>Some symptoms may include a mass or lump in the mouth, neck, cheek, or tongue. It feels like a large fluid filled sac. In addition, cystic hygromas can be found in other body parts such as the arm, chest, legs, groin, and buttocks.
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>A baby with a prenatally diagnosed cystic hygroma should be delivered in a major medical center equipped to deal with neonatal complications. An obstetrician usually decides the method of delivery. If the cystic hygroma is large, a cesarean section may be performed. After birth, infants with persistent cystic hygroma must be monitored for airway obstruction. A thin needle may be used to reduce the volume of the cystic hygroma to prevent facial deformities and airway obstruction. Close observation of the baby by a neonatalogist after birth is recommended. If resolution of the cystic hygroma does not occur before birth, a pediatric surgeon should be consulted. 
</div><div>Cystic hygromas that develop in the third trimester (after thirty weeks gestation) or in the postnatal period are usually not associated with chromosome abnormalities. There is a chance of recurrence after surgical removal of the cystic hygroma. The chance of recurrence depends on the extent of the cystic hygroma and whether the wall of the cyst was able to be completely removed Treatments for removal of cystic hygroma are surgery or sclerosing agents which include:

</div><div>HEMANGIOMA
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>A small hemangioma of infancy
</div><div>A hemangioma is a benign, and usually a self-involuting tumor, (swelling or growth) of the endothelial cells that line blood vessels and is characterised by increased number of normal or abnormal vessels filled with blood. It usually appears during the first weeks of life and generally resolves by age 10. In more severe cases hemangiomas may leave residual tissue damage. In infancy, it is the most common tumor The word "hemangioma" comes from the Greek haema- , "blood"; angeio "vessel"; -oma "tumor". 
</div><div>The terminology used to define, describe and categorize vascular anomalies, abnormal lumps made up of blood vessels, has changed. The term hemangioma was originally used to describe any vascular tumor-like structure, whether it was present at or around birth or appeared later in life. Mulliken et al. categorized these conditions into two families: a family of self-involuting tumors, growing lesions that eventually disappear, and another family of malformations, enlarged or abnormal vessels present at birth and essentially permanent. The importance of this distinction is that it makes it possible for early-in-life differentiation between lesions that will resolve versus those that are permanent. Examples of permanent malformations include port-wine stains (capillary vascular malformation) and masses of abnormal swollen veins (venous malformations).[2] 
</div><div>] Signs and symptoms
</div><div>Hemangiomas are connected to the circulatory system. The appearance depends on location. If they are on the surface of the skin, they are reminiscent of a ripe strawberry (hence, they are sometimes referred to as "strawberry hemangiomas"); however, if they are just under the skin they present as a bluish swelling. Sometimes they grow in internal organs such as the liver or larynx. In most cases, hemangiomas will disappear over time. Some are formed during gestation; the most common are not congenital, but appear during the first few weeks of life. They are often initially misdiagnosed as a scratch or bruise; but the correct diagnosis becomes obvious with further growth. Typically, at the earliest phase in a superficial lesion, one will see a bluish red area with obvious blood vessels and surrounding pallor. Sometimes they present as a flat red or pink area. Hemangiomas are the most common childhood tumor, occurring in approximately ten percent of Caucasians, and are less prevalent in other ethnicities. Females are three to five times as likely to have hemangiomas as males. Hemangiomas are also more common in twin pregnancies. Approximately 80% are located on the face and neck, with the next most prevalent location being the liver.

</div><div>•	 
</div><div>A liver hemangioma as seen on CT 
</div><div>Causes
</div><div>The cause of hemangioma is currently unknown; however, several studies have suggested the importance of estrogen signaling in hemangioma proliferation. In 2007, a paper from the Stanford Children's Surgical Laboratory revealed that localized soft tissue hypoxia coupled with increased circulating estrogen after birth may be the stimulus There is also a hypothesis presented by researchers at Harvard and the University of Arkansas that maternal placenta embolizes to the fetal dermis during gestation resulting in hemangiomagenesis However, researchers at Duke University conducted genetic analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphism in hemangioma tissue compared to the mother's DNA that contradicted this hypothesis. More research is required in order to fully understand the explosive nature of hemangioma growth, which will hopefully yield targeted therapeutics to treat its most complicated presentations. 
</div><div>Review of Histology
</div><div>Under the microscope, hemangiomas are unencapsulated aggregates of closely packed, thin-walled capillaries, usually with endothelial lining. Blood-filled vessels are separated by scant connective tissue. Their lumens may be thrombosed and organized. Hemosiderin pigment due to vessel rupture sometimes can be noticed. Glut1 is a histochemical marker, highly specific for Haemangioma and can be used to differentiate Haemangioma from vascular malformations.
</div><div>Complications
</div><div>The vast majority of hemangiomas are not associated with complications. Hemangiomas may break down on the surface, called ulceration. If the ulceration is deep, significant bleeding may occur in rare occasions. Ulceration on the deeper area can be painful and problematic. If a hemangioma develops in the larynx, breathing can be compromised. A hemangioma can grow and block one of the eyes, causing an occlusion amblyopia. Very rarely, extremely large hemangiomas can cause high-output heart failure due to the amount of blood that must be pumped to excess blood vessels. Lesions adjacent to bone can also cause erosion of the bone. 
</div><div>The most frequent complaints about hemangiomas, however, stem from psychosocial complications: the condition can affect a person's appearance and can provoke attention and malicious reactions from others. Particular problems occur if the lip or nose is involved, as distortion can be difficult to treat surgically. The potential for psychological injury develops from school age onward. It is therefore important to consider treatment prior to school if adequate spontaneous improvement has not occurred. 
</div><div>Children with large segmental hemangiomas of the head and neck can be associated with a disorder called PHACES Syndrome. 
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>Most hemangiomas disappear without treatment, leaving minimal or no visible marks. Large hemangiomas can leave visible skin changes secondary to severe stretching of the skin or damage to surface texture. When hemangiomas interfere with vision, breathing, or threaten significant cosmetic injury (facial lesions and in particular, nose and lips), they are usually treated.
</div><div>&nbsp;Until recently, the mainstay of treatment was oral corticosteroid therapy, but there are now alternative treatments. A randomized trial showed that the beta-blocker propranolol reduced severe hemangiomas in infants  The topically applied beta blocker solution/gel Timolol is also being trialled for small facial hemangiomas that do not justify systemic treatment Other treatments that have been used include interferon[ or vincristine. They may be considered if first-line therapy fails. 
</div><div>Surgical removal is sometimes indicated, particularly if there has been delay in commencing treatment and structural changes have become irreversible. Surgery may also be necessary to correct distortion of facial features, again in the case of inadequate or failed early medical intervention. Blockage of the airway will often require a tracheostomy to be performed, which involves the insertion of an external airway through the front of the neck into the trachea below the level of the obstruction. 
</div><div>Smaller raised lesions are sometimes treated with injection of corticosteroid directly into the lesion. A pulsed dye laser can be useful for very early, flat, superficial lesions, if they appear in cosmetically significant areas or for those lesions that leave residual surface blood vessels in the case of incomplete resolution Sometimes a pulsed dye laser can be used to accelerate healing. Unfortunately, raised lesions or lesions under the skin do not respond to laser treatment. Ulceration will usually heal with topical medication and special dressings under medical supervision. Applying a pressure is not benificial, thus not recommended. 
</div><div>Prognosis
</div><div>Hemangiomas go through three stages of development and decay: 
</div><div>1.	In the proliferation stage, a hemangioma grows very quickly. This stage can last up to twelve months. 
</div><div>2.	In the rest stage, there is very little change in a hemangioma's appearance. This usually lasts until the infant is one to two years old. 
</div><div>3.	In the involution phase, a hemangioma finally begins to diminish in size. 50% of lesions will have disappeared by 5 years of age, and the vast majority will have gone by 10.

</div><div>POLYDACTYLY
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>27-year-old male with unilateral polydactyly affecting the left thumb. The supernumerary digit had normal sensation but no joint and hence could not move independently.
</div><div>Polydactyly or polydactylism (from Ancient Greek  (polus) "many" + (daktulos) "finger"), also known as hyperdactyly, is a congenital physical anomaly in humans, dogs, and cats having supernumerary fingers or toes Polydactyly is the opposite of oligodactyly (too few fingers or toes). 
</div><div>The extra digit is usually a small piece of soft tissue that can be removed. Occasionally it contains bone without joints; rarely it may be a complete, functioning digit. The extra digit is most common on the ulnar (little finger) side of the hand, less common on the radial (thumb) side, and very rarely within the middle three digits. These are respectively known as postaxial (little finger), preaxial (thumb), and central (ring, middle, index fingers) polydactyly. The extra digit is most commonly an abnormal fork in an existing digit, or it may rarely originate at the wrist as a normal digit does.[2]. The world record holder for highest number of digits is Akshat Saxena from Uttar Pradesh, India. He was born in 2010 with 7 digits on each hand and 10 digits on each foot, for a total of 34 digits.

</div><div>&nbsp;Genetics
</div><div>Polydactyly can occur by itself, or more commonly, as one feature of a syndrome of congenital anomalies. When it occurs by itself, it is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in single genes, i.e. it is not a multifactorial trait.[4] But mutation in a variety of genes can give rise to polydactyly. Typically the mutated gene is involved in developmental patterning, and a syndrome of congenital anomalies results, of which polydactyly is one feature or two.

</div><div>DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA
</div><div>Diaphragmatic hernia is a defect or hole in the diaphragm that allows the abdominal contents to move into the chest cavity. Treatment is usually surgical.
</div><div>The following types of diaphragmatic hernia exist:
</div><div>•	Congenital diaphragmatic hernia 
</div><div>o	Morgagni's hernia
</div><div>o	Bochdalek hernia
</div><div>•	Hiatal hernia
</div><div>•	Iatrogenic diaphragmatic hernia
</div><div>•	Traumatic diaphragmatic hernia
</div><div>Signs and symptoms
</div><div>A scaphoid abdomen ( sucked inwards ) may be the presenting symptom in a newborn. 
</div><div>Diagnosis
</div><div>Diagnosis can be made by either CT or X-ray.
</div><div>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
</div><div>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a congenital malformation (birth defect) of the diaphragm. The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia; other types include Morgagni hernia, diaphragm eventration and central tendon defects of the diaphragm. Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the proper lung formation.
</div><div>CDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants, and a major cause of death due to two complications: pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Experts disagree on the relative importance of these two conditions, with some focusing on hypoplasia, others on hypertension. Newborns with CDH often have severe respiratory distress which can be life-threatening unless treated appropriately.
</div><div>Types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia
</div><div>Bochdalek hernia
</div><div>The Bochdalek hernia, also known as a postero-lateral diaphragmatic hernia, is the most common manifestation of CDH, accounting for more than 95% of cases In this instance the diaphragm abnormality is characterized by a hole in the postero-lateral corner of the diaphragm which allows passage of the abdominal viscera into the chest cavity. The majority of Bochdalek hernias (80-85%) occur on the left side of the diaphragm, a large proportion of the remaining cases occur on the right side, and a small fraction are bilateral, i.e., left- and right-sided defects. 
</div><div>Morgagni hernia
</div><div>This rare anterior defect of the diaphragm is variably referred to as Morgagni, retrosternal, or parasternal hernia. Accounting for approximately 2% of all CDH cases, it is characterised by herniation through the foramina of Morgagni which are located immediately adjacent to the xiphoid process of the sternum The majority of hernias occur on the right side of the body and are generally asymptomatic; However newborns may present with respiratory distress at birth similar to Bochdalek hernia. Additionally, recurrent chest infections and gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in those with previously undiagnosed Morgagni hernia. In asymptomatic individuals laparoscopic surgical repair is still recommended as they are at risk of a strangulated intestine.
</div><div>Diaphragm eventration
</div><div>The diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic eventration is used when there is abnormal displacement (i.e. elevation) of part or all of an otherwise intact diaphragm into the chest cavity. This rare type of CDH occurs because in the region of eventration the diaphragm is thinner, allowing the abdominal viscera to protrude upwards. This thinning is thought to occur because of incomplete muscularisation of the diaphragm, and can be found unilaterally or bilaterally Minor forms of diaphragm eventration are asymptomatic, however in severe cases infants will present with respiratory distress similar to Bochdalek hernia. 
</div><div>Pathophysiology
</div><div>It involves three major defects.
</div><div>•	A failure of the diaphragm to completely close during development.
</div><div>•	Herniation of the abdominal contents into the chest
</div><div>•	Pulmonary hypoplasia
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;Presentation and diagnosis
</div><div>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: coronal obstetric ultrasound (head to right of image, thorax centre, abdomen left) shows the stomach and heart both within the thorax.
</div><div>This condition can often be diagnosed before birth and fetal intervention can sometimes help, depending on the severity of the condition Infants born with diaphragmatic hernia experience respiratory failure due to both pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia. The first condition is a restriction of blood flow through the lungs thought to be caused by defects in the lung. Pulmonary hypoplasia or decreased lung volume is directly related to the abdominal organs presence in the chest cavity which causes the lungs to be severely undersized, especially on the side of the hernia.
</div><div>Survival rates for infants with this condition vary, but have generally been increasing through advances in neonatal medicine. Work has been done to correlate survival rates to ultrasound measurements of the lung volume as compared to the baby's head circumference. This figure known as the lung to head ratio (LHR).A small percentage of cases go unrecognized into adulthood. 
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>First step in management is orogastric tube placement and securing the airway (intubation). The baby will usually be immediately placed on a ventilator. ECMO has been used as part of the treatment strategy at some hospitals. Diaphragm eventration is typically repaired thoracoscopically, by a technique called plication of the diaphragm. Plication basically involves a folding of the eventrated diaphragm which is then sutured in order to “take up the slack” of the excess diaphragm tissue.

</div><div>MICROGNATHISM
</div><div>Micrognathism (or Micrognathia) is a condition where the jaw is undersized. It is also sometimes called "Mandibular hypoplasia".It is common in infants,[ but is usually self-corrected during growth, due to the jaws increasing in size. It may be a cause of abnormal tooth alignment and in severe cases can hamper feeding
</div><div>&nbsp;Causes
</div><div>While not always pathological, it can present as a birth defect in multiple syndromes including: fetal alcohol syndrome, congenital rubella, DiGeorge's Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Pierre Robin syndrome, Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, Trisomy 13(Patau syndrome), Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), X0 syndrome (Turner syndrome), Noonan syndrome, Progeria, Treacher Collins syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, Seckel syndrome, Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Cri du chat syndrome, Bloom syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Craniofacial microsomia (Goldenhar Syndrome), and Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome.
</div><div>Diagnosis
</div><div>It can be detected by the naked eye as well as dental or skull X-Ray testing

</div><div>SPINA BIFIDA
</div><div>&nbsp;

</div><div>Spina bifida (Latin: "split spine") is a developmental congenital disorder caused by the incomplete closing of the embryonic neural tube. Some vertebrae overlying the spinal cord are not fully formed and remain unfused and open. If the opening is large enough, this allows a portion of the spinal cord to protrude through the opening in the bones. There may or may not be a fluid-filled sac surrounding the spinal cord. Other neural tube defects include anencephaly, a condition in which the portion of the neural tube that will become the cerebrum does not close, and encephalocele, which results when other parts of the brain remain unfused.
</div><div>Spina bifida malformations fall into three categories: spina bifida occulta, spina bifida cystica with meningocele, and spina bifida cystica with myelomeningocele. The most common location of the malformations is the lumbar and sacral areas. Myelomeningocele is the most significant and common form, and this leads to disability in most affected individuals. The terms spina bifida and myelomeningocele are usually used interchangeably.
</div><div>Spina bifida can be surgically closed after birth, but this does not restore normal function to the affected part of the spinal cord. Intrauterine surgery for spina bifida has also been performed, and the safety and efficacy of this procedure is currently being investigated. The incidence of spina bifida can be decreased by up to 70% when daily folic acid supplements are taken prior to conception.

</div><div>Spina bifida occulta
</div><div>Occulta is Latin for "hidden". This is the mildest form of spina bifida In occulta, the outer part of some of the vertebrae are not completely closedThe splits in the vertebrae are so small, the spinal cord does not protrude. The skin at the site of the lesion may be normal, or it may have some hair growing from it; there may be a dimple in the skin, or a birthmark. Many people with this type of spina bifida do not even know they have it, as the condition is asymptomatic in most cases The incidence of spina bifida occulta is approximately 10% of the population, and most people are diagnosed incidentally from spinal X-rays. A systematic review of radiographic research studies found no relationship between spina bifida occulta and back pain. More recent studies not included in the review support the negative findings
</div><div>However, other studies suggest spina bifida occulta is not always harmless. One study found, among patients with back pain, severity is worse if spina bifida occulta is present
</div><div>Meningocele
</div><div>The least common form of spina bifida is a posterior meningocele (or meningeal cyst). In this form, the vertebrae develop normally, but the meninges are forced into the gaps between the vertebrae. As the nervous system remains undamaged, individuals with meningocele are unlikely to suffer long-term health problems, although cases of tethered cord have been reported. Causes of meningocele include teratoma and other tumors of the sacrococcyx and of the presacral space, and Currarino syndrome.
</div><div>A meningocele may also form through dehiscences in the base of skull. These may be classified by their localisation to occipital, frontoethmoidal, or nasal. Endonasal meningoceles lie at the roof of the nasal cavity and may be mistaken for a nasal polyp. They are treated surgically. Encephalomeningoceles are classified in the same way and also contain brain tissue.
</div><div>&nbsp;Myelomeningocele
</div><div>This type of spina bifida is the most common and often results in the most severe complications. In individuals with myelomeningocele, the unfused portion of the spinal column allows the spinal cord to protrude through an opening. The meningeal membranes that cover the spinal cord form a sac enclosing the spinal elements. Spina bifida with myeloschisis is the most severe form of myelomeningocele. In this type, the involved area is represented by a flattened, plate-like mass of nervous tissue with no overlying membrane. The exposure of these nerves and tissues make the baby more prone to life-threatening infections such as meningitis. The protruded portion of the spinal cord and the nerves that originate at that level of the cord are damaged or not properly developed. As a result, there is usually some degree of paralysis and loss of sensation below the level of the spinal cord defect. Thus, the more cranial the level of the defect, the more severe the associated nerve dysfunction and resultant paralysis may be. People may have ambulatory problems, loss of sensation, deformities of the hips, knees or feet, and loss of muscle tone.
</div><div>
</div><div>Physical complications
</div><div>Physical signs of spina bifida may include:
</div><div>•	Leg weakness and paralysis
</div><div>•	Orthopedic abnormalities (i.e., club foot, hip dislocation, scoliosis)
</div><div>•	 Bladder and bowel control problems, including incontinence, urinary tract infections, and poor renal function
</div><div>•	Pressure sores and skin irritations
</div><div>•	Abnormal eye movement
</div><div>The spinal cord lesion or the scarring due to surgery may result in a tethered spinal cord. In some individuals, this causes significant traction and stress on the spinal cord and can lead to a worsening of associated paralysis, scoliosis, back pain, and worsening bowel and/or bladder function
</div><div>&nbsp;Neurological complications
</div><div>Many individuals with spina bifida will have an associated abnormality of the cerebellum, called the Arnold Chiari II malformation. In affected individuals, the back portion of the brain is displaced from the back of the skull down into the upper neck. In about 90% of the people with myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus will also occur because the displaced cerebellum interferes with the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, causing an excess of the fluid to accumulate. In fact, the cerebellum also tends to be smaller in individuals with spina bifida, especially for those with higher lesion levels
</div><div>The corpus callosum is abnormally developed in 70-90% of individuals with spina bifida myelomeningocele; this impacts the communication processes between the left and right brain hemispheres. Further, white matter tracts connecting posterior brain regions with anterior regions appear less organized. White matter tracts between frontal regions have also been found to be impaired.
</div><div>&nbsp;Cortex abnormalities may also be present. For example, frontal regions of the brain tend to be thicker than expected, while posterior and parietal regions are thinner. Thinner sections of the brain are also associated with increased cortical folding. Neurons within the cortex may also be displaced. 
</div><div>Executive function
</div><div>Several studies have demonstrated difficulties with executive functions in youth with spina bifida, with greater deficits observed in youth with shunted hydrocephalus Unlike typically developing children, youth with spina bifida do not tend to improve in their executive functioning as they grow older.  Specific areas of difficulty in some individuals include planning, organizing, initiating, and working memory. Problem-solving, abstraction, and visual planning may also be impaired Further, children with spina bifida may have poor cognitive flexibility. Although executive functions are often attributed to the frontal lobes of the brain, individuals with spina bifida have intact frontal lobes; therefore, other areas of the brain may be implicated. 
</div><div>Academic skills
</div><div>Individuals with spina bifida may struggle academically, especially in the subjects of mathematics and reading. 
</div><div>Individuals with spina bifida tend to have better reading skills than mathematics skills. Children and adults with spina bifida have stronger abilities in reading accuracy compared to reading comprehension. Comprehension may be especially impaired for text that requires an abstract synthesis of information rather than a more literal understanding. Individuals with spina bifida may have difficulty with writing due to deficits in fine motor control and working memory. 
</div><div>Social complications
</div><div>Compared to typically developing children, youth with spina bifida may have fewer friends and spend less time with peers. They may be more socially immature and more passive in social situations These children have also reported feeling less close to their friends and feel they do not receive as much emotional support from their friendships. Many social difficulties tend to be stable, lasting into adulthood. Youth encountering the most social difficulties tend to have lower executive functioning and shunted hydrocephalus 
</div><div>Pathophysiology
</div><div>Spina bifida is caused by the failure of the neural tube to close during the first month of embryonic development (often before the mother knows she is pregnant).
</div><div>Under normal circumstances, the closure of the neural tube occurs around the 23rd (rostral closure) and 27th (caudal closure) day after fertilization. However, if something interferes and the tube fails to close properly, a neural tube defect will occur. Medications such as some anticonvulsants, diabetes, having a relative with spina bifida, obesity, and an increased body temperature from fever or external sources such as hot tubs and electric blankets may increase the chances of delivery of a baby with a spina bifida.
</div><div>Extensive evidence from mouse strains with spina bifida indicates sometimes a genetic basis for the condition. In human spina bifida, as with other human diseases, such as cancer, hypertension and atherosclerosis (coronary artery disease), spina bifida likely results from the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors.
</div><div>Research has shown the lack of folic acid (folate) is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects, including spina bifida. Supplementation of the mother's diet with folate can reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by about 70%, and can also decrease the severity of these defects when they occur. It is unknown how or why folic acid has this effect.
</div><div>Spina bifida does not follow direct patterns of heredity like muscular dystrophy or haemophilia. Studies show a woman having had one child with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida has about a 3% risk of having another child with a neural tube defect. This risk can be reduced to about 1% if the woman takes high doses (4 mg/day) of folic acid before and during pregnancy. For the general population, low-dose folic acid supplements are advised (0.4 mg/day]
</div><div>Prevention
</div><div>There is neither a single cause of spina bifida nor any known way to prevent it entirely. However, dietary supplementation with folic acid has been shown to be helpful in reducing the incidence of spina bifida. Sources of folic acid include whole grains, fortified breakfast cereals, dried beans, leaf vegetables and fruits. 
</div><div>Folate fortification of enriched grain products has been mandatory in the United States since 1998. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Public Health Agency of Canada and UK recommended amount of folic acid for women of childbearing age and women planning to become pregnant is at least 0.4 mg/day of folic acid from at least three months before conception, and continued for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Women who have already had a baby with spina bifida or other type of neural tube defect, or are taking anticonvulsant medication should take a higher dose of 4–5 mg/day.
</div><div>&nbsp;Certain mutations in the gene VANGL1 are implicated as a risk factor for spina bifida: These mutations have been linked with spina bifida in some families with a history of spina bifida
</div><div>Pregnancy screening
</div><div>Neural tube defects can usually be detected during pregnancy by testing the mother's blood (AFP screening) or a detailed fetal ultrasound. Increased levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) should be followed up by two tests - an ultrasound of the fetal spine and amniocentesis of the mother's amniotic fluid (to test for alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase). Spina bifida may be associated with other malformations as in dysmorphic syndromes, often resulting in spontaneous miscarriage. In the majority of cases, though, spina bifida is an isolated malformation.
</div><div>Genetic counseling and further genetic testing, such as amniocentesis, may be offered during the pregnancy, as some neural tube defects are associated with genetic disorders such as trisomy 18. Ultrasound screening for spina bifida is partly responsible for the decline in new cases, because many pregnancies are terminated out of fear that a newborn might have a poor future quality of life. With modern medical care, the quality of life of patients has greatly improved. 
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>Ultrasound view of the fetal spine at 21 weeks of pregnancy. In the longitudinal scan a lumbar myelomeningocele is seen.
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>There is no known cure for nerve damage caused by spina bifida. To prevent further damage of the nervous tissue and to prevent infection, pediatric neurosurgeons operate to close the opening on the back. The spinal cord and its nerve roots are put back inside the spine and covered with meninges. In addition, a shunt may be surgically installed to provide a continuous drain for the excess cerebrospinal fluid produced in the brain, as happens with hydrocephalus. Shunts most commonly drain into the abdomen or chest wall. However, if spina bifida is detected during pregnancy, then open fetal surgery can be performed
</div><div>In childhood
</div><div>Most individuals with myelomeningocele will need periodic evaluations by a variety of specialists:
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Orthopedists monitor growth and development of bones, muscles, and joints.
</div><div>•	Neurosurgeons perform surgeries at birth and manage complications associated with tethered cord and hydrocephalus.
</div><div>•	Neurologists treat and evaluate nervous system issues, such as seizure disorders.
</div><div>•	Urologists to address kidney, bladder, and bowel dysfunction - many will need to manage their urinary systems with a program of catheterization. Bowel management programs aimed at improving elimination are also designed.
</div><div>•	Ophthalmologists evaluate and treat complications of the eyes.
</div><div>•	Orthotists design and customize various types of assistive technology, including braces, crutches, walkers, and wheelchairs to aid in mobility. As a general rule, the higher the level of the spina bifida defect, the more severe the paralysis, but paralysis does not always occur. Thus, those with low levels may need only short leg braces, whereas those with higher levels do best with a wheelchair, and some may be able to walk unaided.
</div><div>•	Physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, and speech/language pathologists aid in rehabilitative therapies and increase independent living skills.
</div><div>•	Physiatrists coordinate the rehabilitation efforts of the different therapists and to prescribe specific therapies, adaptive equipment, or medications to encourage as high of a functional performance within their community as possible.

</div><div>CLUB FOOT
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>bilateral club foot
</div><div>A club foot, or congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), is a congenital deformity involving one foot or both The affected foot appears rotated internally at the ankle. TEV is classified into 2 groups: Postural TEV or Structural TEV.
</div><div>Without treatment, persons afflicted often appear to walk on their ankles, or on the sides of their feet. It is a common birth defect, occurring in about one in every 1,000 live births. Approximately 50% of cases of clubfoot are bilateral. In most cases it is an isolated dysmelia. This occurs in males more often than in females by a ratio of 2:1. A condition of the same name appears in animals, particularly horses.
</div><div>Deformities
</div><div>The deformities affecting joints of the foot occur at three joints of the foot to varying degrees. They are
</div><div>•	Inversion at subtalar joint
</div><div>•	Adduction at talonavicular joint and
</div><div>•	equinus and varus at ankle joint, that is, a plantar flexed position, making the foot tend towards toe walking.
</div><div>•	 The deformities can be remembered using the mnemonic, "InAdEquate" for Inversion, Adduction and Equinus.
</div><div>&nbsp;Causes
</div><div>There are different causes for clubfoot depending on what classification it is given. Structural cTEV is caused by genetic factors such as Edwards syndrome, a genetic defect with three copies of chromosome 18. Growth arrests at roughly 9 weeks and compartment syndrome of the affected limb are also causes of Structural cTEV. Genetic influences increase dramatically with family history. It was previously assumed that postural cTEV could be caused by external influences in the final trimester such as intrauterine compression from oligohydramnios or from amniotic band syndrome. However, this is countered by findings that cTEV does not occur more frequently than usual when the intrauterine space is restricted.[5] Breech presentation is also another known cause cTEV occurs with some frequency in Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and some other connective tissue disorders, such as Loeys-Dietz Syndrome. TEV may be associated with other birth defects such as spina bifida cystica.
</div><div>Etymology of Term
</div><div>Equinovarus is an odd description. Equino = "like a horse". To make sense of that you need to know that the horse hoof is a big toenail and that the horse's back pointing joint is like our heel. So walking on toe is the equino part. Varus means that the part distal from the one named slants toward body mid line. 
</div><div>Prenatal Screening
</div><div>Screening for club foot prenatally is a debatable topic. However, this is commonly done as it is easily identified using an ultrasound scan. Most fetuses undergo a 20 weeks gestation fetal abnormality scan in which club foot is one of the abnormalities that can be picked up. Some doctors have argued that club foot may occasionally be associated with a syndromic disease and should therefore be screened. If no syndromic association is found prenatally, most fetuses with club foot are born and can live a normal life with medical treatment.
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>Clubfoot is treated with manipulation by podiatrists, physiotherapists, orthopedic surgeons, specialist Ponseti nurses, or orthotists by providing braces to hold the feet in orthodox positions, serial casting, or splints called knee ankle foot orthoses (KAFO). Other orthotic options include Dennis-Brown bars with straight last boots, ankle foot orthoses and/or custom foot orthoses (CFO). In North America, manipulation is followed by serial casting, most often by the Ponseti Method. Foot manipulations usually begin within two weeks of birth. Even with successful treatment, when only one side is affected, that foot may be smaller than the other, and often that calf, as well.
</div><div>Extensive surgery of the soft tissue or bone is not usually necessary to treat clubfoot; however, there are two minimal surgeries that may be required:
</div><div>1.	Tenotomy (needed in 80% of cases) is a release (clipping) of the Achilles tendon – minor surgery – local anesthesia
</div><div>2.	Anterior Tibial Tendon Transfer (needed in 20% of cases) – where the tendon is moved from the first ray (toe) to the third ray in order to release the inward traction on the foot.
</div><div>Of course, each case is different, but in most cases extensive surgery is not needed to treat clubfoot. Extensive surgery may lead to scar tissue developing inside the child's foot. The scarring may result in functional, growth and aesthetic problems in the foot because the scarred tissue will interfere with the normal development of the appendage. A child who has extensive surgery may require on average two additional surgeries to correct the issues presented above.
</div><div>In stretching and casting therapy the doctor changes the cast multiple times over a few weeks, gradually stretching tendons until the foot is in the correct position of external rotation. The heel cord is released (percutaneous tenotomy) and another cast is put on, which is removed after three weeks. To avoid relapse a corrective brace is worn for a gradually reducing time until it is only at night up to four years of age.
</div><div>Non-surgical treatment and the Ponseti Method
</div><div>Treatment for clubfoot should begin almost immediately to have the best chance for a successful outcome without the need for surgery. Over the past 10 to 15 years, more and more success has been achieved in correcting clubfeet without the need for surgery. The clubfoot treatment method that is becoming the standard in the U.S. and worldwide is known as the Ponseti Method Foot manipulations differ subtly from the Kite casting method which prevailed during the late 20th century. Although described by Dr. Ignacio Ponseti in the 1950s, it did not reach a wider audience until it was re-popularized around 2000 by Dr. John Herzenberg in the USA and in Europe and Africa by NHS surgeon Steve Mannion while working in Africa. Parents of children with clubfeet using the Internet[9] also helped the Ponseti gain wider attention. The Ponseti method, if correctly done, is successful in &gt;95% of cases in correcting clubfeet using non- or minimal-surgical techniques. Typical clubfoot cases usually require 5 casts over 4 weeks. Atypical clubfeet and complex clubfeet may require a larger number of casts. Approximately 80% of infants require an Achilles tenotomy (microscopic incision in the tendon requiring only local anesthetic and no stitches) performed in a clinic toward the end of the serial casting.
</div><div>Throughout the past decade, physicians at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children have been studying the effectiveness of both the Ponseti casting method and the French functional (physical therapy) method of stretching, massaging and taping and comparing the results with patients who have undergone surgery. 
</div><div>After correction has been achieved, maintenance of correction may require the full-time (23 hours per day) use of a splint—also known as a foot abduction brace (FAB)—on both feet, regardless of whether the TEV is on one side or both, for several weeks after treatment. Part-time use of a brace (generally at night, usually 12 hours per day) is frequently prescribed for up to 4 years. Without the parents' participation, the clubfoot will almost certainly recur, because the muscles around the foot can pull it back into the abnormal position. Approximately 20% of infants successfully treated with the Ponseti casting method may require a surgical tendon transfer after two years of age. While this requires a general anesthetic, it is a relatively minor surgery that corrects a persistent muscle imbalance while avoiding disturbance to the joints of the foot.
</div><div>The developer of the Ponseti Method, Dr Ignacio Ponseti, was still treating children with clubfeet (including complex/atypical clubfeet and failed treatment clubfeet) at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics well into his 90s. He was assisted by Dr Jose Morcuende, president of the Ponseti International Association.
</div><div>The long-term outlook for children who experienced the Ponseti Method treatment is comparable to that of non-affected children.
</div><div>Botox is also being used as an alternative to surgery. Botox is the trade name for Botulinum Toxin type A. a chemical that acts on the nerves that control the muscle. It causes some paralysis(weakening) of the muscle by preventing muscle contractions (tightening). As part of the treatment for clubfoot, Botox is injected into the child’s calf muscle. In about 1 week the Botox weakens the Achilles tendon. This allows the foot to be turned into a normal position, over a period of 4–6 weeks, without surgery.
</div><div>The weakness from a Botox injection usually lasts from 3–6 months. (Unlike surgery it has no lasting effect). Most club feet can be corrected with just one Botox injection. It is possible to do another if it is needed. There is no scar or lasting damage 
</div><div>Surgical treatment
</div><div>On occasion, stretching, casting and bracing are not enough to correct a baby's clubfoot. Surgery may be needed to adjust the tendons, ligaments and joints in the foot/ankle. Usually done at 9 to 12 months of age; surgery usually corrects all clubfoot deformities at the same time. After surgery, a cast holds the clubfoot still while it heals. It is still possible for the muscles in the child's foot to try to return to the clubfoot position, and special shoes or braces will likely be used for up to a year or more after surgery. Surgery will likely result in a stiffer foot than nonsurgical treatment, particularly over time.
</div><div>Without any treatment, a child's clubfoot will result in severe functional disability, however with treatment, the child should have a nearly normal foot. He or she can run and play without pain and wear normal shoes. The corrected clubfoot will still not be perfect, however; a clubfoot usually stays 1 to 1½ sizes smaller and somewhat less mobile than a normal foot. The calf muscles in a leg with a clubfoot will also stay smaller.

</div><div>IMPERFORATE ANUS
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>An X-ray showing Imperforate anus
</div><div>An imperforate anus or anorectal malformations (ARMs) are birth defects in which the rectum is malformed. ARMs are a spectrum of different congenital anomalies in males and females, that varies from fairly minor lesions, as well as complex anomalies. The cause of ARMs is unknown, the genetic basis of these anomalies is very complex because of their anatomical variability, in an 8% of patients genetic factors are clearly associated with ARMs  Anorectal Malformation in Currarino Syndrome represent the only association for which the gene HLXB9 has been identified
</div><div>Features
</div><div>There are several forms of imperforate anus and anorectal malformations.The new classification is in relation of the type of associated fistula The classical classification was in low,and high anomalies:
</div><div>•	A low lesion, in which the colon remains close to the skin. In this case, there may be a stenosis (narrowing) of the anus, or the anus may be missing altogether, with the rectum ending in a blind pouch.
</div><div>•	A high lesion, in which the colon is higher up in the pelvis and there is a fistula connecting the rectum and the bladder, urethra or the vagina.
</div><div>•	A persistent cloaca (from the term cloaca, an analogous orifice in reptiles and amphibians), in which the rectum, vagina and urinary tract are joined into a single channel.
</div><div>Imperforate anus is usually present along with other birth defects—spinal problems, heart problems, tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies are among the possibilities.[5]
</div><div>Associated anomalies
</div><div>Imperforate anus is associated with an increased incidence of some other specific anomalies as well, together being called the VACTERL association:
</div><div>•	V - Vertebral anomalies
</div><div>•	A - Anal atresia
</div><div>•	C - Cardiovascular anomalies
</div><div>•	T - Tracheoesophageal fistula
</div><div>•	E - Esophageal atresia
</div><div>•	R - Renal (Kidney) and/or radial anomalies
</div><div>•	L - Limb defects
</div><div>Diagnosis
</div><div>When an infant is born with an anorectal malformation, it is usually detected quickly as it is a very obvious defect. Doctors will then determine the type of birth defect the child was born with and whether or not there are any associated malformations. It is important to determine the presence of any associated defects during the newborn period in order to treat them early and avoid further sequelae. There are two main categories of anorectal malformations: those that require a protective colostomy and those that do not. The decision to open a colostomy is usually taken within the first 24 hours of birth. Sonography can be used to determine the type of imperforate anus. 
</div><div>Treatment
</div><div>Imperforate anus usually requires immediate surgery to open a passage for feces unless a fistula can be relied on until corrective surgery takes place. Depending on the severity of the imperforate, it is treated either with a perineal anoplasty[7] or with a colostomy.
</div><div>Prognosis
</div><div>With a high lesion, many children have problems controlling bowel function and most also become constipated. With a low lesion, children generally have good bowel control, but they may still become constipated.
</div><div>For children who have a poor outcome for continence and constipation from the initial surgery, further surgery to better establish the angle between the anus and the rectum may improve continence and, for those with a large rectum, surgery to remove that dilated segment may significantly improve the bowel control for the patient. An antegrade enema mechanism can be established by joining the appendix to the skin (Malone stoma); however, establishing more normal anatomy is the priority.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Epidemiology
</div><div>Imperforate anus has an estimated incidence of 1 in 5000 births. It affects boys and girls with similar frequency. However, imperforate anus will present as the low version 90% of the time in females and 50% of the time in males.
</div><div>Imperforate anus is an occasional complication of sacrococcygeal teratoma

</div><div>OMPHALOCELE
</div><div>An omphalocele (British English: omphalocoele) is a type of abdominal wall defect in which the intestines, liver, and occasionally other organs remain outside of the abdomen in a sac because of a defect in the development of the muscles of the abdominal wall (exomphalos). Omphalocele occurs in 2.5/10,000 births and is associated with a high rate of mortality (25%) and severe malformations, such as cardiac anomalies (50%) and neural tube defect (40%). Approximately 15% of live-born infants with omphalocele have chromosomal abnormalities.
</div><div>Presentation
</div><div>The sac, which is formed from an outpouching of peritoneum, protrudes in the midline, through the umbilicus (navel).
</div><div>It is normal for the intestines to protrude from the abdomen, into the umbilical cord, until about the tenth week of pregnancy, after which they return to inside the fetal abdomen.
</div><div>The omphalocele can be mild, with only a small loop of intestines present outside the abdomen, or severe, containing most of the abdominal organs. In severe cases surgical treatment is made more difficult because the infant's abdomen is abnormally small, having had no need to expand to accommodate the developing organs.
</div><div>The presence of an omphalocele is often associated with cardiac defects
</div><div>Screening
</div><div>An omphalocele is often detected through AFP screening or a detailed fetal ultrasound. Genetic counseling and genetic testing such as amniocentesis are usually offered during the pregnancy.
</div><div>Causes
</div><div>Some cases of omphalocele are believed to be due to an underlying genetic disorder, such as Edward's syndrome (Trisomy 18)[1][2] or Patau Syndrome (Trisomy 13).
</div><div>GASTROSCHISIS
</div><div>&nbsp;is a similar birth defect, but in gastroschisis the umbilical cord is not involved and the lesion is usually to the right of midline. Parts of organs may be free in the amniotic fluid, and not enclosed in a membranous (peritoneal) sac. This condition is less commonly associated with other defects than omphalocele.
</div><div>PYLORIC STENOSIS
</div><div>&nbsp;

</div><div>Pyloric stenosis (or infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis) is a condition that causes severe projectile non-bilious vomiting in the first few months of life. There is narrowing (stenosis) of the opening from the stomach to the first part of the small intestine known as the duodenum, due to enlargement (hypertrophy) of the muscle surrounding this opening (the pylorus, meaning "gate"), which spasms when the stomach empties. This hypertrophy is felt classically as an olive-shaped mass in the middle upper part or right upper quadrant of the infant's abdomen. In pyloric stenosis, it is uncertain whether there is a real congenital narrowing or whether there is a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. This condition typically develops in male babies in the first 2–6 weeks of life.
</div><div>Pyloric stenosis also occurs in adults where the cause is usually a narrowed pylorus due to scarring from chronic peptic ulceration. This is a different condition from the infantile form.
</div><div>Signs and symptoms
</div><div>Babies with this condition usually present any time in the first weeks to months of life with progressively worsening vomiting. The vomiting is often described as non-bile stained ("non bilious") and "projectile vomiting", because it is more forceful than the usual spittiness (gastroesophageal reflux) seen at this age. Some infants present with poor feeding and weight loss, but others demonstrate normal weight gain. Dehydration also can occur causing the baby to cry without having tears, and having less wet or dirty nappies such as going hours or a couple days without having anything Constant hunger, belching, and colic are other possible signs as the baby is not able to eat properly.
</div><div>Diagnosis
</div><div>Diagnosis is via a careful history and physical examination, often supplemented by radiographic studies. There should be suspicion for pyloric stenosis in any young infant with severe vomiting. On exam, palpation of the abdomen may reveal a mass in the epigastrium. This mass, which consists of the enlarged pylorus, is referred to as the 'olive', and is sometimes evident after the infant is given formula to drink. It is an elusive diagnostic skill requiring much patience and experience. There are often palpable (or even visible) peristaltic waves due to the stomach trying to force its contents past the narrowed pyloric outlet.
</div><div>Most cases of pyloric stenosis are diagnosed/confirmed with ultrasound, if available, showing the thickened pylorus. Although somewhat less useful, an upper GI series (x-rays taken after the baby drinks a special contrast agent) can be diagnostic by showing the narrowed pyloric outlet filled with a thin stream of contrast material; a "string sign" or the "railroad track sign". For either type of study, there are specific measurement criteria used to identify the abnormal results. Plain x-rays of the abdomen are not useful, except when needed to rule out other problems.
</div><div>Blood tests will reveal hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to loss of gastric acid (which contain hydrochloric acid and potassium) via persistent vomiting; these findings can be seen with severe vomiting from any cause. The potassium is decreased further by the body's release of aldosterone, in an attempt to compensate for the hypovolaemia due to the severe vomiting.
</div><div>Pathophysiology
</div><div>The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. The exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknownThe vomited material does not contain bile because the pyloric obstruction prevents entry of duodenal contents (containing bile) into the stomach.
</div><div>This results in loss of gastric acid (hydrochloric acid). The chloride loss results in hypochloremia which impairs the kidney's ability to excrete bicarbonate. This is the significant factor that prevents correction of the alkalosis. A secondary hyperaldosteronism develops due to the hypovolemia. The high aldosterone levels causes the kidneys to avidly retain Na+ (to correct the intravascular volume depletion), and excrete increased amounts of K+ into the urine (resulting in hypokalaemia).
</div><div>The body's compensatory response to the metabolic alkalosis is hypoventilation resulting in an elevated arterial pCO2.

</div><div>Infantile pyloric stenosis is typically managed with surgery; very few cases are mild enough to be treated medically.
</div><div>The danger of pyloric stenosis comes from the dehydration and electrolyte disturbance rather than the underlying problem itself. Therefore, the baby must be initially stabilized by correcting the dehydration and hypochloremic alkalosis with IV fluids. This can usually be accomplished in about 24–48 hours.
</div><div>Intravenous and oral atropine may be used to treat pyloric stenosis. It has a success rate of 85-89% compared to nearly 100% for pyloromyotomy, however it requires prolonged hospitalization, skilled nursing and careful follow up during treatment. It might be an alternative to surgery in children who have contraindications for anesthesia or surgery.
</div><div>Surgery
</div><div>The definitive treatment of pyloric stenosis is with surgical pyloromyotomy known as Ramstedt's procedure (dividing the muscle of the pylorus to open up the gastric outlet). This is a relatively straightforward surgery that can possibly be done through a single incision (usually 3–4 cm long) or laparoscopically (through several tiny incisions), depending on the surgeon's experience and preference
</div><div>Today, the laparoscopic technique has largely supplanted the traditional open repairs which involved either a tiny circular incision around the navel or the Ramstedt procedure. Compared to the older open techniques, the complication rate is equivalent, except for a markedly lower risk of wound infection. This is now considered the standard of care at the majority of Children Hospitals across the US, although some surgeons still perform the open technique. Following repair, the small 3mm incisions are hard to see.
</div><div>The vertical incision, pictured and listed above, is no longer usually required. Though many incisions have been horizontal in the past years.
</div><div>Once the stomach can empty into the duodenum, feeding can commence. Some vomiting may be expected during the first days after surgery as the gastro-intestinal tract settles. Very occasionally the myotomy was incomplete and projectile vomiting continues, requiring repeat surgery. But the condition generally has no long term side-effects or impact on the child's future.
</div><div>Epidemiology
</div><div>Males are more commonly affected than females, with firstborn males affected about four times as often, and there is a genetic predisposition for the disease It is commonly associated with people of Jewish ancestry, and has multifactorial inheritance patterns Pyloric stenosis is more common in Caucasians than Hispanics, Blacks, or Asians. The incidence is 2.4 per 1000 live births in Caucasians, 1.8 in Hispanics, 0.7 in Blacks, and 0.6 in Asians. It is also less common amongst children of mixed race parents Caucasian babies with blood type B or O are more likely than other types to be affected
</div><div>Infants exposed to erythromycin are at increased risk for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, especially when the drug is taken around two weeks of life.
